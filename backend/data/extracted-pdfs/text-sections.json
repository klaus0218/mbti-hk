This has been true of all work in the \nresearch, development, and application of the Myers-Briggs \nType Indicator carried out under the auspices of Consulting \nPsychologists Press. The philosophy embodies a combination \nof tradition and change. \n\nThe value of tradition and the commitment to change \nare based on the vision, mission, and goals of Katharine \nCook Briggs and her daughter, Isabel Briggs Myers, in their \ncollaboration to create an instrument to identify Jungian \npersonality type. \n\nThe shared vision of Katharine Briggs and Isabel Myers \nwas to enable individuals to grow through an understand- \ning and appreciation of individual differences in healthy per- \nsonality and to enhance harmony and productivity among \ndiverse groups.\" Briggs and Myers believed that Car! Jungs \nunderstanding of human development, his theoretical model \nencompassing psychological type, his concept of the process \nof individuation, and his structure of the psyche offered the \nmost promising approach. Their mission was to give the \nindividual access to the benefits of this understanding. \n\nIn following this tradition we have placed special empha- \nsis on holding to the spirit of Jung, Briggs, and Myers in their \nnever-ending quest for deeper understanding of emerging \nideas, the possibilities of new and untried methods, and the \n\nForeword \n\ninsights of expanding knowledgethus our commitment to \na \"tradition of change.\" The development of both the instr- \nment and the theory should be viewed as an ongoing process. \n\nThis ongoing process is richly illustrated in the MBTI \nManual. Since the death of Isabel Myers in 1980, much has \nbeen learned from a large body of new research, from the \nexperience of thousands of practitioners, from developments \nin effective feedback, and trom refinements in Jungian theory \ncoupled with insights from complementary theories. In addi- \ntion, new technology and psychometric methodology have \nmade significant contributions. \n\nFor those of us who remember Isabel Myers working in \nrelative isolation from early in the morning until late at night \nfor nearly four decades, the phenomenon of the large group \nof talented, knowledgeable people who worked together on \nthis manual and the new Form M seems awesome and won- \ndrous. It has been an exciting project for those involved; the \nauthors, editors, coordinators, and production team. We are \nproud of the fine collaborative spirit displayed throughout \nand the wonderful relationships that have developed. For \nmany years, Isabel Myers was the primary researcher. This \nmanual pulls together the work of hundreds of researchers \nand practitioners. We are indebted to each of them. \n\nKatharine Downing Myers \nPeter Briggs Myers \nJune 1998 \n\nXV \n\naay ut SLT on CUOR- B = \"25 4 whi p* i 2s vetu \n\n\"nns a 21g NA Md a. \\ wile D 5 \ngv demus A die diene ng EIo",

This pur- \npose, together with the introduction of Form M of the \nMyers-Briggs Type Indicator?, was central to the develop- \nment of this new edition of the MBTI Manual. A second, \neven more powerful, objective of this revision was to rein- \nforce the connection of the MBTI to its roots in the psycho- \nlogical type theorv of Carl G. Jung. \n\nOne consequence of the popularity of the MBTI is that it \nhas become increasingly detached from psychological type \ntheoryoften to the detriment of the individuals whom it \nis intended to benefit. Reconnecting the MBTI to type the- \nory has critical practical implications and applications. In \nthis regard, the overall goal of this edition is identical to \nthat of the two editions that preceded it, and indeed to that \nof the Indicator itself: to make the theory of psychological \ntypes described by Jung understandable and useful in peo- \nples lives. \n\nIn this edition the registered trademark notation appears \nand the MBTI is described as a personality inventory. \nThese additions are not without significance. The trade- \nmark addresses a second consequence of popularitythe \nneed to ensure that the origins and ownership of the MBTI \nare acknowledged and protected. Specifying that the MBTI \nis a personality inventory rather than some other kind of \nassessment tool discourages its misuse as a test of skills or \nabilities or as a simple measure of a particular construct, \nsuch as cognitive styles. Such possible misunderstanding \nis just one problematic result of detaching the instrument \nfrom its theoretical roots. An associated and far more seri- \nous issue is mistaking the MBTI for a personality trait mea- \nsure rather than a dynamic typology. Readers will find many \nreferences to and clarifications of this issue in the chapters \nmaking up all five parts of the manual. \n\nAs the essential reference for users of the MBTI, the man- \nual is organized with the goal of promoting maximum under- \nstanding and ease of application. Part I, Introduction, gives \n\nPreface \n\na broad overview of the distinctive features of the MBTI and \nits basis in Jungs type theory, details the 50-year develop- \nment of the instrument, and explores the rationale and pur- \nposes behind the development of the new standard Form M. \nPart II, Theory, explains Jungs dynamic theory of type and \nthe ways in which Myers and Briggs extended and clarified \nit when they created their instrument. Combinations of \npreferences and the 16 types are described and research evi- \ndence is summarized to help make the dynamic core of psy- \nchological type accessible and meaningful to users. Part IH, \n\"Administration and Interpretation,\" gives practitioners the \nbasic information necessary to use the MBTI effectively and \noffers practical insights into issues that influence these two \ncritical arcas. Part IV, Research, covers the wealth of infor- \nmation relevant to the psychometric features of the MBTI \nwith regard to its construction, reliability, and validity. It \ndescribes the new method of selecting items for and scoring \nForm M through item response theory (IRT) and contrasts it \nwith the prediction ratio method used for previous forms of \nthe Indicator. The focus on type dynamics and whole types \nthat permeates Parts I through IV culminates in Part V, The \nUses of Type,\" which provides hands-on, practical guidance",

Briggs, coauthor of the MBTI, for \nher original theory of type that predated her discovery of \n\nJungs theory, for her penetrating analysis of the part \n\nplayed by the judgment-perception preference in her struc- \nture of Jungian types, and for her indispensable collabora- \ntion in the writing of the Type Indicator and support in its \ndevelopment.\" In the acknowledgments to the 1985 Man- \nual, Mary McCaulley commented, The influence of Isabel \nMvers permeates this volume. Some sections of this mannal \nwere written by her. In other sections, her ideas are sum- \nmarized, using written records supplemented by notes of \n\nxvii \n\nxviii \n\nMBTI Manual \n\nhundreds of hours of discussions over the decade the two \nauthors worked together. . . . This work reflects Myers six \ndecades of interest in Jungs theory of psychological types \nand four decades of research to devclop a way of putting \nJungs theory to practical use.\" \n\nWhen Isabel Myers died in 1980, Mary McCaulley took \non the immense revision task that culminated in the 1985 \nManual. Her extensive knowledge of the MBTI and her \ncommitment to Myers' vision of a world able to make *con- \nstructive usc of differences\" enabled her to produce an out- \nstanding work almost singlehandedly. tt covered all the pro- \nfcssional requirements for a psychological test manual with \ngrcat clarity and precision. It was unique, however, in being \naccessible to both the professional psychologists for whom \nit was intended and laypeople who had little or no psycho- \nlogical training. As such, the 1985 Manual was the training \nvchicle for thousands of professionals now using the Mvers- \nBriges Type Indicator \n\nThe goal of addressing the needs of both psychological \nprofessionals and the variety of professionals in other fields \nwho usc the Indicator was central to the writing of every \n\nchapter in this manual. To further address this need, a com- \nprehensive glossary of terms appears at the end of the man- \nual. The Glossary covers all relevant terms that appear in \nthe manual, including guidelines for using terminology ina \nconsistent and accurate manner. Also included are items \nthat are not referred to explicitly in the manual, but that are \nrelevant and uscful to professionals interested in the MBTI, \nsuch as Isabel Briggs Mycrs Memorial Library and CAPT- \nMBTI Data Bank. To accommodate users in other countries, \nthe glossary includes definitions of such terms as grade \npoint average and middle school. \n\nThis 1998 revision of Isabel Briggs Myers monumental \nlifes work both celebrates the centennial of her birth and \nmoves her accomplishments into the twenty-first century. It \nis our hope that it will bring us closer to Myers' vision of a \nworld in which Jungs theory of type promotes, through the \nMBTI, the constructive use of differences. \n\nNaomi L.

The depth and especially the breadth of \nknowledge about the MBTI and its applications that are \nnecessary 13 years later are beyond the seope of one person. \nThus the volume reflects major efforts from a number of \npeople who either revised existing chapters or wrote new \nones. All contributed within the tradition established by \nMyers and McCaulley, and they made every effort to retain \nthe original language wherever possible. \n\nMartha Wilson Alcock, R. J.

Harvey con- \ntributed his knowledge and research methods in using item \nresponse theory in the construction and analysis of Form \nM, and Wayne Mitchell contributed his research and inter- \npretation of studies on type dynamics and whole type. \n\nA number of individuals either revised chapters exten- \nsively or created new chapters for Part V.

As you read Chapter 1, you \nwill become aware of the following: \n\nmg The MBTI identifies preferences rather than competencies. \n\ngm The eight characteristics that are defined in the MBTI \nare not traits that vary in quantity; they are dichoto- \nmous constructs that deseribe equally legitimate but \nopposite ways in which we use our minds. \n\nm Ihe MBTI describes a dynamic personality system such \nthat the 16 types are greater than the sum of their parts. \n\ng The dynamic and developmental approach of the MBTI \ninvolves the interplay of the dominant, auxiliary, ter- \ntiary, and inferior functions that were specified by Jung. \n\ngm The new standard Form M uses a different statistical \nmethod for scoring from the one used in earlier forms. \n\nm There are five major fields in which the MBTI is cur- \nrently being used. \n\n2 Introduction \n\nChapter 2, A Tradition of Change, focuses on the essen- \ntial features of the MBTI as an implementation of Jungs the- \nory.

G. Jung (1921/1971) \nunderstandable and useful in seonles lives. The essenee of \nthe theory is that mueh seemingly random variation in \nbehavior is actually quite orderly and consistent, being due \nto basie differences in the way individuals prefer to use their \npereeption and judgment. \n\nPereeption involves all the ways of becoming aware of \nthings, people, happenings, or ideas. Judgment involves all \nthe ways of coming to conclusions about what has been \nperceived. If people differ systematically in what they per- \nceive and in how they reach conclusions, then it is only rea- \nsonable for them to differ correspondingly in their interests, \nreactions, values, motivations, and skills. \n\nIn developing the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, the aim of \nIsabel Briggs Myers and her mother, Katharine Briggs, was \nto make the insights of type theory accessible to individuals \nand groups. They addressed two related goals in the devel- \nopment and application of the MBTT instrument: \n\nl. The identification of basic preferences on each of \nthe four dichotomies specified or implicit in Jung's \ntheory. The MDTI personality inventory (also re- \nferred to as the Indicator) is based on Jungs ideas \nabout how different ways ot perceiving and judging, \nin combination with different attitudes, describe dit- \nferent types of people. Perception and judgment are \nconceived of as mental functions; the term attitudes \nrefers to orientation of energy and orientation to the \n\n4 Introduction \n\nexternal world. Personality types result from inter- \nactions among the four MBTI dichotomies. These \ndichotomies encompass four opposite domains of \nmental functioning: opposite ways of percciving, oppo- \nsite ways of judging, opposite attitudes in which pre- \nferred perception and preferred judgment are typi- \ncally used, and opposite ways of relating to the world. \n\n. The identification and description of the 16 distinc- \ntive personality types that result from interactions \namong the preferences. A type is not created by sim- \nply adding the four preferred ways of functioning. \nEach type described by Jung and Myers is greater than \nthe sum of its parts because of the different interac- \ntions among the four preferences that make up a type. \nBy identifying the preferences, the combinations of \npreferences, and how the combined preferences oper- \nate as whole dynamice types, researchers can establish \neffects and put them to practical use. \n\nn \n\nBecause the MBTI is based on a theory and beca.i;s^ \nthe variety of ways in which it has been applied, this man- \nual has four equally important goals: \n\nB To provide users with an adequate understanding of psy- \nchological type theory \n\nB To explain the psychometric properties of the instru- \nment that are a direct consequence of the theory upon \nwhich it is based, which requires the identification of \nqualitatively different types rather than the more com- \nmonly measured universal traits \n\nB To present the research that demonstrates the reliability, \nvalidity, and psychometric soundness of the instrument \n\nE To serve as an essential handbook for using the MBTI in \na wide variety of settings \n\nThe goal of this chapter is to provide readers with the \norientation needed to make mximum use of the remaining \nchapters. The chapter therefore covers the intended uses of \nthe manual, a general overview of Jungs psychological type \ntheory, issues in identifying MBTI preferences, and the var- \nied uses of the MBTI. \n\nHow to Use This Manual \n\nThis third edition of The MBTI Manual: A Guide to the Devel- \nopment and Use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator is a revision \nof the 1985 edition and covers information relevant to \nunderstanding and using type as obtained from the new \nstandard Form M, which replaces Form G.

Separate manuals are avail- \nable for these extended forms of the MBTI (Mitchell, in \npress; Saunders, 1987, 1989). \n\nY \n\nReaders of this manual who are new to the MBTI instru- \nment will want to pay careful attention to the sections on \nJungs theory and the modifications of the theory con- \ntributed by Myers and Briggs (Chapters 3 and 4). Experi- \nenced users of the Indicator will be particularly interested \nin the sections that describe why the MBTI was revised \n(Chapter 2) and how the revision relates to the construc- \ntion and properties (Chapter 7) and the reliability and \nvalidity (Chapters 8 and 9) of the MBTI. \n\nBoth new and seasoned MBTI practitioners will benefit \nfrom a careful review of the theoretical and psychometric \ndifferences between the MBTI and other personality instru- \nments. Chapters 3 and + provide the theoretical foundation \nfor the Indicator, and Chapter 7 its essential psychometric \nfeatures. In addition, theoretical and psychometric differ- \nences between the MBTI and other instruments have \nimportant implications for both the administration of the \ninstrument (Chapter 5) and its interpretation to clients \n(Chapter 6). Familiarity with all of these differences will \nensure effective use of the instrument with clients in all \nareas in which the MBTI is appropriately applied. In addi- \ntion, researchers will profit from the detailed explanation of \nthe distinctive psychometrie features (Chapters 7, 8, and 9) \nof the Indicator, as this will enable them to use the most \nappropriate research designs and data analysis techniques. \nThe varied ways in which the Indicator is effectively applied \nappear in Chapters 10 through 14. These chapters give \ndetailed information about the way the MBTI has been used \nin each application setting and a summary of relevant \nresearch. \n\nAs compared with previous editions, the emphasis \nthroughout this edition of the manual is on the dynamic \ncharacter of whole, four-letter types with correspondingly \nless attention given to evidence concerning the preferences \nthat make up single dichotomies. This emphasis character- \nizes all or most of the chapters that cover theoretical con- \nsiderations, psychometric analyses, and research on appli- \ncations in the many areas relevant to type. \n\nDifferences Between the MBTI \nand Other Instruments \n\nThe MBTI differs from most other personality instruments \nin that the theory upon which it is based postulates \ndichotomies. These dichotomies are believed to reflect \ninnate psychological or mental dispositions. The require- \nment that the instrument reflect these dichotomies has \nbeen a major factor in the design of items, use of numerical \ninformation to determine type preferences, general psycho- \nmetric properties, and interpretation of results of the MBTI. \nThe following points summarize the instruments important \ndistinguishing features. \n\nm The MBTI is different from typical trait approaches to \n\npersonality that measure variation along a continuum; \ninstead, the Indicator seeks to identify a respondents \nstatus on either one or the other of two opposite personal- \nity categories, both of which are regarded as neutral in \nrelation to emotional health, intellectual functioning, \nand psychological adaptation. Each of the categories \nspecified in the instrument represents a multifaceted \ndomain of psychological functioning. The assumption is \nthat one of each pair of categories is inherently more \nappealing than the other to a particular respondent. Thus \nthe forced-choice format of items is designed to reveal a \npreference between equally viable mental processes and \nattitudes. In contrast, trait-based instruments typically \ndefine a dimension or scale as a single trait. \n\nThe type-trait distinction leads to quite different mean- \nings for the scores of trait instruments and MBTI prefer- \nence clarity indexes. For example, a person with a high \nscore on the Extraversion scale of the NEO Personality \nInventory \" (NEO-PI), a trait instrument (Costa &amp; \nMcCrae, 1985), is seen as having more Extraversion than \na person with a low score on that scale, and a person with \na low score on the scale may be viewed as having a deficit \nof the identified personality trait of Extraversion. In con- \ntrast, MBT} preference clarity indexes indicate how \nclearly a respondent prelers one of two opposite poles of \na dichotomy, not how much of that pole she or he has. \nEach preference in a pair is a construct with its own legit- \nimate content that is separate and distinct from the con- \ntent of the opposite preference. Opposite preferences are \nnot adequately described by using one or the other as the \ndefinitive criterion. For example, Introversion is not \ndescribed as a lack of Extraversion, nor is Extraversion \nseen as a deficit in Introversion.",

    "content": "Because the requirement is to sort individuals into \nopposite categories rather than to measure an amount or \ndegree of a trait as is done in trait-based instruments, \nthe numerical preference clarity index on the MBTI \nreflects the degree of confidence in the accuracy of place- \nment of a respondent into a particular type category. Chap- \nter 6 provides guidelines for estimating degrees of conh- \ndence in category placements. \n\nAs a self-reported indicator of complex underlying psy- \nchological processes, preference clarity indexes associ- \nated with MBTI type categories are properly viewed as \ntrustworthy indications of the accuracy of an individ- \nuals results. However, the focus of the MBTI is on its \nusefulness to respondents. Therefore, verification of the \naccuracy ol the indicated type by the respondent is essen- \ntial. MBTI results do not tell a person who she or he \nis. Rather, individual respondenis are viewed as experts \nwho are best qualified 10 judge the accuracy of the type \ndescriptions that result from their self-report. Chapter 6 \ncovers recommended techniques and procedures for \nhelping clients assess the accuracy of their reported \nMBTI type and identily the type that best fits them. \n\nOverview 5 \n\nw Based on the theory, there are specific dynamic relation- \nships among the four preferences (Extraversion or \nIntroversion, Sensing or Intuition, Thinking or Fecling, \nJudging or Perceiving) that lead to the descriptions and \ncharacteristics of the 16 personality types. Further, \nalthough the four dichotomies identified by the MBTI \nare psychometrically independent of each other, the \ndynamic characteristics of each type are not reflected in \na simple summation of an individual's four preferences. \nRather, each of ihe 16 types results from a specilied \ninteraction that is consistent with the Jung and Myers \ntheory. Understanding these dynamic interactions aids \nthe interpretation and verification process and provides \ncritical information for applications and research. \n\nm The type descriptions are designed to reflect a theory that \nincludes a model of devclopment that continues through- \nout the lifespan. As a result, specific hypotheses relevant \nto different ages and stages of life can be made and tested \nempirically. For example, the theory predicis thai \nyounger persons are generally less clear and consistent in \ntheir preferences than are mature individuals. As a result, \nwe expect lower reliability coefficients when testing sam- \nples of young people and higher reliabilities with older \nsubjects. This hypothesis is clearly confirmed in a num- \nber of samples in the 1985 Manual, although sufficiently \nlarge samples of young people are not yet available on \nForm M to allow for a definite conclusion. In coming to \nconclusions about the reliability of the Indicator, there- \nfore, it is important to recognize that samples that include \na wide range of ages will demonstrate lower reliabilities \nthan samples limited to mature, well-functioning adults. \nWhereas such a result helps validate the developmental \naspect of the theory, failure to recognize the basis for dif- \nferential reliabilities can lead to an erroneous conclusion \nregarding the overall reliability of the instrument. \n\nm The MBTI dichotomies are concerned with basic attitudes \nand mental functions that enter into almost every aspect of \nbehavior; therefore the scope of practical applications is \nbroad rather than narrow and includes quite varied aspects \nof living. This is evident in the number of different applica- \ntions covered in Part V of this manual, The Uses ol Type. \n\nOverview of Psychological \nType Theory \n\nType theory as used in this manual relers to Jungs theory as \ninterpreted by Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs in the \nMyers-Briggs Type Indicator personality inventory. The \ndynamic character specified by type theory involves the \ninteraction of a persons four basic preferences. This section \ndescribes thc opposites that make up each dichotomy and \nthe 16 types that result from interactions among the four \npreferences. \n\n6 Introduction \n\nThe Four Preferences That Make Up a Type \n\nThe MBTI instrument identifies four separate dichotomies: \nExtraversion versus Introversion, Sensing versus Intuition, \nThinking versus Feeling, and Judging versus Perceiving. An \nindividual is assumed to have a preference for one of each \npair of opposites over the other. The four preferences direct \nthe characteristic use of perception and judgment by an \nindividual. The particular preferences that interact in a per- \nson affect not only what is attended to in any given situation \nbut also how conclusions arc drawn about what has been \nperceived. The four dichotomies of the MBTI are described \nin the following sections and are outlined in Table 1.1. The \nMBTI classifies the first and fourth dichotomies listed as atti- \ntudes or orientations and the middle two dichotomies as \nfunctions or processes. Attitude and orientation are used",

Jung regarded Extraversion and \nIntroversion as mutually complementary attitudes whose \ndifferences generate the tension that both the individual and \nsocicty need for the maintenance of life (p. 160). Jung thus \nsaw both Extraversion and Introversion as necessary for \npsychological adaptation. \n\nSensing or Intuition (S-N)! The S-N dichotomy is de- \nsigned to reflect a persons preference between two opposite \n\nways of percciving.  person may rely primarily upon the \nprocess of Sensing (S), which attends to observable facts or \nhappenings through one or more of the five senses, or a \nperson may rely more upon the less obvious process of \nIntuition (N), which attends to meanings, relationships, \nand/or possibilities that have been worked out beyond the \nreach of the conscious mind. \n\nThinking or Feeling (TF) The T-F dichotomy is designed \n\nto reflect a persons preference between two contrasting \nways of making a judgment. A person may rely primarily on \nThinking (T) to decide impersonally on the basis of logical \nconsequences, or a person may rely primarily on Feeling \n(F) to decide primarily on the basis of personal or social \nvalues. In Jungs and Myers approaches, the term Thinking \ndoes not imply intelligence or competence, and the term \nFeeling is not to be confused with emotional. Intelligence \nand emotional expression are independent of psychological \n\ntypology. \n\nJudging or Perceiving (JP) The J-P dichotomy is designed \nto identify the process a person tends to use in dealing with \n\nthe outer world, that is, with the extraverted part of life. A \nperson who prefers using a Judging (J) process typically \nuses cither Thinking or Feeling (the Judging processes) \nwhen dealing with the outer world. A person who preters a \nPerceiving (P) process reports a preference for using either \nSensing or Intuition (the perceiving processes) when \ndealing with the outer world. lt should be noted that Myers \nand Briggs believed this dichotomy was implicit in Jungs \ntheory, but it was not explicitly described in Jungs writings. \nChapter 3 elucidates Briggs and Myers extension of type \ntheory in this regard. \n\nIt is important to note that a preference for one alterna- \ntive of each dichotomy docs not mean that the opposite, \nless-preferred alternative is never used. Both the theory and \npractical observations describe individuals as using cach of \n\nthe eight preference categories at least some of the timc. \nThus a person who typically uses Thinking (T) when \nextravertinga person with a Judging (J ) attitudeimay at \ntimes extravert the preferred or even less-preferred Perceiv- \ning (P) process, even though such an approach may not be \ntypical lor the person. \n\nThe l6 Types \n\nAccording to theory, each of the 16 types results from a \npreference for one pole of cach of the four dichotomies over \nthe opposite pole. A preference on any onc dichotomy is \ndesigned to be psychometrically independent of the prefer- \nences on the other three dichotomies.^ Therefore, prefer- \nences on the four dichotomies yield 16 possible combina- \ntions called types, which are denoted by the four letters \nidentifying the poles preferred (e.g., ESTJ, INFP). \n\nThe theorv postulates specific dynamic relationships",

For each type, one process is the \nleading, or dominant, process and a second process serves as \nan auxiliary process that provides balance in the personal- \nity. Each type has its own pattern of dominant and auxiliary \nprocesses and the attitudes (E or 1) in which these are habit- \nually used. Determining these dynamic relationships is \nenabled by the J-P dichotomy of the MBTI and is fully \nexplained in Chapter 3. The distinctive characteristics of \neach type follow from the dynamic interplay of processes \nand attitudes. \n\nIn terms of the theory, people may reasonably be \nexpected to develop greater comfort and facility with the \nprocesses they preler to use and with the attitudes in \nwhich they prefer to use them. For example, if they prefer \nthe Extraverted (E) attitude, they are likely to be more \nconfident and effective in dealing with the outer world \nthan with the Introverted (1) world of concepts, ideas, and \ninner expcriences. If they prefer the perceiving process of \nSensing (S), they are likely to be more confident and effec- \ntive in dealing with facts and realities than in dealing with \ntheories and possibilities, which are in the sphere of Intu- \nition (N). H they prefer the judgment process o! Thinking \n(T), they are likely to rely more heavily on objective \nThinking judgments than on the values that underlie Feel- \ning (F) judgments. And if they prefer to use Judging (J) \nrather than Perceiving (P) in interacting with the world \naround them, they are likely to be more comfortable when \nthey can organize the events of their lives than when they \ncan only experience and adapt to them. On the other \nhand, if a person prefers Introversion, Intuition, Feeling, \nand Perceiving (INFP), then the converse of the descrip- \ntion above is likely to be truc. \n\nThe preferences and the specific dynamics of their inter- \nactions are discussed further in Chapters 3 and 4 of this \nbook, in Gifts Differing (Myers with Myers, 1980/1995), in \nIntroduction to Type Dynamics and Development (Myers &amp; \nKirby, 1994), and in other publications. \n\nOverview 7 \n\nIdentifying MBTI Preferences \n\nThe main objective of the MBTI is to identify which of two \nopposite categories is preferred on each of the four di- \nchotomies. The Indicator obtains a numerical score based \non responses favoring one pole versus its opposite. These \ncalculations are designed not as scales for measurement of \ntraits or behaviors but rather as indications of preference for \none pole ol a dichotomy or its opposite. The letters E or I, S \nor N, T or E and J or P are used to designate which of the \nopposite sides of a respondents nature are preferred. The \nintent is to reflect a habitual choice between rival alterna- \ntives, analogous to right-handedness or left-handedness. \nOne expects to use both the right and left hands, even \nthough one reaches first with the preferred hand. Similarly, \neveryone is assumed to use both sides ol each of the four \ndichotomies but to respond first, most often, and most \ncomfortably with the preferred functions and attitudes. \n\nItems and Preference Clarity Index \n\nThe MBTI items require forced choices between the poles ol \nthe dichotomy at issuc. Choices are between seemingly \ninconsequential everyday events, chosen by Myers as stimuli \nto evoke the more comprehensive underlying type prefer- \nences. All choices reflect the two poles of the same dichot- \nomy, that is, E or I, Sor N, Tor EJ or P On the computer- \nscored version of Form M, responses that best predict to \ntotal preference carry greater weight. On the template- and \nself-scorable versions, all the items have the same weight \nand are simply counted to determine which preference \nreceived the most answers. Technical details of item con- \nstruction and weighting as developed and tested by Myers, \nas well as the methodology used in the current revision of \nthe instrument, appear in Chapters 2 and 7. \n\nForm M computer-scored versions yield preferences \nbased on an established midpoint. When a respondents score \nis to the right of the midpoint, the preference indicated is I, \nN, E or P. When the score is to the left of the midpoint, the \npersons preference is E, S, T, or J. Tied scores are designated \nas I, N, E or P in both the Myers and Form M scoring. The \npreference letters indicate which of each pair of opposites the \nperson prefers and presumably has developed or is likely to \ndevelop to a greater degree. For example, a preference letter E \nsuggests that the person prefers extraverting to introverting \nand probably has spent more time extraverting than intro- \nverting. Consequently, that person is likely to seek out and be \nmore comfortable with activities that call for Extraversion \nthan activities that call lor Introversion. For instance, such a \nperson will presumahly find greater satisfaction in a career \nthat requires more extraverting than introverting. \n\nAs evidence that a preference has been accurately",

Preference clarity \nindexes range from I to 30 on cach of the four dichotomies. \n\n8 Introduction \n\nThe higher the index, the greater the clarity of preference \nthat can be assumed. For example, a person whose prefer- \nence clarity index for Thinking is T 28 could be said to be \nmuch more clear in this preference than a person with T \n9at least based on responses to the Indicator items. The \ncharacteristics associated with a preference may be (but are \nnot necessarily) less apparent when a low clarity index is \nassociated with a preference. A low preference clarity index \nresults from almost equal votes for cach opposite pair in a \ndichotomy. It is incorrect to assume, however, that the per- \nson with, for example, N 30 has greater facility with, confi- \ndence in, or kcenness of Intuition than the person reporting \nN 15. Similar cautions apply to all eight preferences identificd \nby the preference clarity indexes of the MBTI. Thus unlike \ntrait scores, health, competence, or maturity cannot be \ninferred from the numerical preference clarity index of the \nMBTI. Chapter 6 discusses these issues in greater detail. \n\nAssumptions Underlying the Types \n\nEach pole of a dichotomy is perceived as valuable and at \ntimes indispensable in its own area of operation. The theory \nassumes that all types can deal elfectively with life in gen- \neral and in their own areas of potential talent in particular. \nAll types are viewed as necessary in a complex world that \nrelies on diversity and specialization to progress toward \nimportant personal and socictal goals. Each type has its \nown special gifts and strengths, its own arcas of vulnerabil- \nity, and its own pathway for development. \n\nThe type description presents these rclationships in \neveryday terms. Each type is described in terms of effective \nuse of the functions and attitudes and also in terms of the \nspecific difficulties arising when type is less developed or \nnot used effectively. The four letters that designate a type \nprovide a compact definition of each type (e.g., EST], INFJ, \nESFP). The dynamic interrelationships of the preferences \narc described in Chapter 3 along with the behavioral char- \nacteristics associated with each preference pattern. \n\nUses of the MBTI Instrument \n\nThe dillerences described by the MBTI are a familiar part \nof everyday life. Jungs theory offers an explanation for \nthese differences that makes it easier to recognize them \nand to use them in constructive ways. The theory is indis- \npensable for understanding and using the MBTI, but the \nmajority of people who have found the MBTI interesting \nand valuable did not have an original interest in Jung. \nRather, general interest in the MBTI is due to the fact that \nalmost every human experience involves either perception \nor judgment and is played out in either the extraverted \nworld of action or the introverted world of reflection. \nThere is therefore a broad range of human activities where \ntype differences are apparent. A good deal of research that \nexamines the ways the MBTI has been applied in the years \nsince publication of the 1985 MBTI Manual appears in \nMBTI Applications: A Dccadc of Rescarch on the Myers- \nBriggs Type Indicator (Hammer, 1996b). The five applica- \ntions chapters that appear in Part V of this manual cover the \nmajor ways the MBTI is currently being used. \n\nConclusion \n\nThis chapter has provided the context for understanding \nand using the MBTI. Users can effectively consult one or \nanother chapter as appropriate to their stage of research or \nparticular application. However, familiarity with the devel- \nopment and construction of the instrument (Chapters 2 \nand 7) and the theory underlying the instrument (Chap- \nters 3 and 4) will maximize the explanatory and predictive \npotential of the MBTI. Reviewing these chapters is there- \nfore recommended. \n\nConstruction of the MBTI \nDevelopment of the MBTI \nThe 1998 Revision \n\nConclusion \n\nA Tradition of Change \n\nhe implementation of Jungs theory of psychological \n\ntype by Isabel Briggs Myers and Katharine Briggs in \nthe Myers-Briggs Type Indicator has endured for more than \n50 years.

The history of the MBTI has been marked \nby evolving ideas of type theory interpretation, application \nof the instrument in new areas, and nearly constant \nresearch. Isabel Briggs Myers herself continually unkered \nwith the items and the scoring procedures. Yet the assump- \ntions underlying the initial construction of the MBTI have \nformed the foundation for the continued devclopment of \nthe instrument.

Copyright 1996 by Consulting Psychologists Press. \n\nUsed with permission \n\nSince its introduction, the Indicator has continued to \nmature through 11 revised forms and alternative methods \nfor administering and scoring those forms (e.g., self- \nscorable, mail-in, template scoring). Between 1988 and \n1997, there were four forms of the Myers-Briggs Type Indi- \ncator in wide useForms E G, J, and Kand three levels \nof interpretation. These three levels are referred to as Steps \nIl, W and Il]. The MBTI Step I consists of four separate \nscales designed to determine a persons preferences on four \ndichotomies, E-1, S-N, T-F, and J-P. The result of Step I \nscoring of the MBTI] is a four-letter type, e.g., ENFP. Two \nscoring variations were created in the 1980s, using Forms J \n\nand K, that extended the original research by Isabel Briggs \nMyers and focused on the measuring of individual differ- \nences within type. These two scoring methodologiesnow \ncalled the MBTI Step II (formerly the Expanded Analysis \nReport, or EAR) and the MBTI Step HI (formerly the Type \nDifferentiation Indicator, or TDI)add depth to the explo- \nration of type dynamics and type development by the addi- \ntion of subscales or facets associated with each of the \n\ndichotomous preferences. Finally, inspired by the observed \nand potential benefits derived from understanding type \ndifferences in educational settings, the Murphy-Meisgcicr \nIype Indicator for Children (MMTIC) was developed in \n1987 by Elizabeth Murphy and Charles Meisgeier. Its pur- \npose is to make type concepts available to younger respon- \ndents and to aid teachers in understanding various learn- \ning styles. \n\nAs the use of the MBTT has grown, so have the applica- \ntions of the instrument. The original use of the Indicator \n\nwas in personal counseling, career counseling, and educa- \ntion. There has been considerable growth of the Indicator \ninto new areas such as organizations, leadership, manage- \nment development, and multicultural settings. \n\nResearch on the instrument has kept pace with the appli- \ncations, with more than 4,000 research studies, journal arti- \ncles, and dissertations written on the Indicator since the \npublication of the first MBTI manual in 1962. This explo- \nsion of research represents one of the most extensive empir- \nical loundations for any psychometric personality assess- \nment. Figure 2.1 shows the number of publications per \nyear. Many of the studies conducted since the publication \nof the 1985 MBTI Manual are summarized in the book \nMBTI Applications: A Decade of Rescarch on the Myers-Briggs \nType Indicator (Hammer, 1996b). \n\nThe purpose of this chapter is to briefly summarize \nwhat has and has not changed with the 1998 revision of \nthe MBTI. Longtime users of the instrument will find this \nmaterial useful in quickly orienting themselves to the \nrevised instrument. New users may not need to read this \nchapter, although they may find it interesting. To place this \nrevision in its propcr context, we first discuss the princi- \nples of construction, including the underlying assump- \ntions guiding the development of the instrument. This is \nfollowed by a review of past developments in the history of \nihe instrument. We then introduce the 1998 revision, fol- \nlowed by a brief summary of the revision process.

The hypothesis is that certain valuable dif- \nferences in normal people result from their preferred ways of \nusing perception and judgment. Each ol thesc preferences, \nbeing a choice between opposites, is by nature either-or, \nthat is, a dichotomy. The MBTI Step I contains four separate \nscales designed to determine a persons prclerences on four \ndichotomies, E-1, S-N, T-E and J-P. Each dichotomy, \naccording to the hypothesis, produces two categories of peo- \nple. An individual will belong to one or the other category \nbased on his or her makeup and inclination. The object of \nthe MBTI is to ascertain, as accurately as possible, the four \ncategories to which the respondent naturally belongs, for \ninstance ENTP or ISFJ. This basic working hypothesis has \nremained as the foundation of the 1998 revision.",

    "content": "Underlying Assumptions \n\nJungs theory of psychological types provided the assump- \ntions and set the tasks for the initial construction of the MBTI \nand for all of the revisions that have been made since, includ- \ning the current one. These assumptions are as follows: \n\nm True preferences\" actually exist. These preferences can \nbe more confidently identified in persons with good type \ndevelopment (see Chapter 3 for an explanation of type de- \nvelopment), than in persons with inadequate type \ndevelopment. However, any instrument must maximize \nthe probability that persons unsure of their preferences \nwill be correctly assigned to a category. \n\nm Persons can give an indication of the preferences that \ncombine to form type, directly or indirectly, on a scH- \nreport inventory. \n\ngm [he preferences are dichotomized, and the two poles of a \npreference are cqually valuable, each in its own sphere. \n\nTypes, Not Traits \n\nThe assumptions stated above are not typical of most psy- \nchological measures. Most current measures ol personality \nhypothesize the existence of one or more psychological \ntraits. In the trait model, the person is assumed to have \nvaried amounts of these characteristics. The instruments \ndesigned to assess traits arc thus intended to measure how \nmuch of the particular characteristic the person possesses. In \nthis model, one end of the trait dimension is usually consid- \nered to be good, or better than the other, and the other end to \nbe bad, or at least less good. Furthermore, in many trait \nmodels, having too much or too little of the characteristic \n(depending on which one is being measured) can be viewed \nas being neurotic. For example, a trait often found on trait- \nbased personality measures is dominance. Based on their \nresponses to test items, people are assigned a score that is \n\nassumed to indicate how much dominance they have. A \nreasonably high score on a dominance scale might be inter- \npreted as positive, suggesting that the person demonstrates \nappropriate amounts of assertion or leadership. Too high of \na score on dominance, however, may be interpreted as indi- \ncating an aggressive or controlling approach to social or work \nsituations. Likewisc, a low score on the dominance scale may \nbc labeled submissive and carry a negative connotation. \n\nIn contrast, the intent of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator \nis specifically not to measure traits, but rather to sort people \ninto equally valuable groups to which, in accordance with \nJungs theory, they already belong. These groups are the 16 \ntypes. This intent has important implications for the con- \nstruction of the instrument and the interpretation of the \nresults, as well as for the kind of evidence sought to estab- \nlish its validity. \n\nMajor Tasks Involved in Construction \n\nThe foregoing basic assumptions have guided the construc- \ntion of the Indicator at cach stage in its long history, includ- \ning the present revision. Although each revision has been \nthe result of a lengthy and complicated process, the follow- \ning outline provides a simple description of the major tasks \ninvolved in the construction of the instrument: \n\nl. Determine items to reflect preferences described by \nJung for Extraversion or Introversion (E-I), Sensing \nor Intuition (S-N), and Thinking or Feeling (T-F). \nAlso, determinc items for thc J-P scale, which was crc- \nated by Myers to identify preferences for the Judging \nor Percciving attitudes in their extraverted appearance, \nso that this information could be used to determine a \ndominant function. \n\n. Write, test, weight, and select items that would achieve \nthe widest separation and least overlap between the two \nkinds of people preferring opposite poles of each scale. \n\n3. Maximize precision in the center, or midpoint, of the \n\nscale, so that persons reporting indeterminate prefer- \nences would be more likely to be classified according \nto their true preference on each dichotomy. \n\nht \n\nDevelopment of the MBTI \n\nThe MBTI has been developing since 1942, continuing to the \npresent revision and publication of Form M in 1998. (A \nmore complete history of the construction of the Indicator is \nfound in Chapter 7 of this manual.) Over this period, \nimprovements to and development of the MBTI have \noccurred in the following areas: language of the items, num- \nber of items, item format, item weights and scoring method, \ngender differences, tic-brcaking method, location of the divi- \nsion point, expansion beyond Step | into additional scoring \nmethods, and composition of the standardization group. \nEach of these is briefly reviewed in the following sections. \n\nl \n\n2 [niroduction \n\nLanguage of the Items \n\nThe language of the items has been changed periodically to \nrellect usage current at the time, and items have sometimes \nbcen modified to eliminate ambiguity or awkward alterna- \ntives. In making changes to items, the guiding principle has \nbeen that the content of the item is less important than the",

    "content": "need for the words and form of the sentence to serve as a \n\"stimulus to evoke a type response.\" What has remained \nconstant is that the responses for each item have been writ- \nten to appeal to the appropriate types. For example, when \nwriting an item for thc J-P scale, every effort has been made \nto make the Perceiving response to a J-P item as attractive to \nPerceiving types as the Judging response is to Judging types. \nThe success of the item in evoking a response from the per- \nson for whom it was intended has always been considcred \nmore important than content coverage of Jungs theory. \n\nFor Form M, a thorough review of all of the items contained \nin Form J of the MBTI was performed to identify those with \noutdated or awkward language. Form J was used because it \ncontained all of the items that had ever been considered in \nyears of testing by Myers. \n\nNumber of Items \n\nPrior to the publication of Form M, the number of items \nacross thc various forms of the Indicator varicd from as few \nas 94 in the self-scoring version of Form G to 290 in Form J. \nNot all of these items have been used in scoring for type, \nhowever; some have been included on various forms for \nresearch purposes. For example, Form G contains 126 \nitems, 94 of which are scored for type and 32 of which are \nunscorcd research items. Also, items on some forms that are \nnot scored for type are used to score the subscales in Step II \nand Step HI scoring procedures. \n\nForm M contains 93 items, all of which are scored for type. \n\nItem Format \n\nOriginally all MBTI items were phrasc questions, followed \nby a choice of two or morc responses. Word-pair questions \nwere added for Forms E and E The instructions in paren- \ntheses for word pairs were added for Form G because inter- \nviews with persons taking Form F revealed that some had \nanswered some of the word pairs on the basis of the sound \nor appearance of the words, not their meaning. \n\nForm M contains both word-pair and phrase questions. \n\nItem Weights and Scoring Method \n\nIn Forms A and B of the Indicator, the items all had the same \nweight, and overall preference was determined by simply \nadding up the number of items indicated for cach preference \n\nlor cach scale. Beginning with Form C, a new scoring sys- \ntem was used, called the prediction ratio (PR) method. The \nprediction ratio shows the probability that, say, a response \ndesigned for Judging types is in fact given by Judging types \nand is not given by Perceiving types. This method yields \nseparate prediction ratios for each of the two responses to \nthe items. In this manner, it takes social desirability into \naccount. This method was employed to arrive at the four \nletters of type for all forms of the Indicator from Form C \nthrough Form K. \n\nForm M uses a method called item response theory (IRT) to \nscore for type. Research conducted for the revision suggests \nthat IRT provides a more precise indication of preference, \nparticularly around the midpoint of the scale, than does the \nprediction ratio method. The new scoring method is described \nin detail in Chapter 7 of this manual. \n\nDifferential Weights by Gender \n\nThroughout the development of the MBTI, all item analyses \nwere computed separately for males and females. In the \nearly forms, separate scoring keys for males and females \nwere used for E-l, S-N, T-F and J-P. Beginning with Forms \nE and E the same keys were used for both genders because \nitem analyses showed that item popularity and prediction \nratios were comparable on E-l, S-N, and J-P. On the T-F \nscale, it was evident that females, even those who in their \nbehavior and attitudes indicated a clear preference for \nThinking, had a greater tendency to give certain Feeling \nresponses than did males. The difference was ascribed \ncither to the possibility that certain Feeling responses were \nmore socially desirable for females than for males or to the \neffect of social training. Separate weights were assigned to \nT-F items for each sex, based on thc prediction ratios for \neach item, with checks that the criterion groups were \nassigned the correct preference. \n\nFor Form M, all of the items in the initial item pool were \nanalyzed using a technique derived from IRT called differen- \ntiol item functioning. All items from any scale that demon- \nstrated significant differential responses by gender were \neliminated from the item pool. This in turn eliminated the \nneed for differential item weights on Form M. \n\nTie-Breaking Method \n\nIn the early stages of the MBTI development, equal points \nfor the poles of the same scale were designated by an x; \nthus a type might be designated IxTJ or ENEx. With Form \nF a tie-breaking formula was adopted. If the raw points \nderived from adding the weights for the item responses \nassociated with each preference were equal, the tie was bro- \nken in the favor of I, N, E or P, depending on the scale. The \nrationale lor this method was that, given U.S. culture, social",

    "content": "desirability may affect a person's responses in the direction \n\nof E, S, T, or J. Thus any ties may be the result of responding \nin a socially desirable manner. \n\nThe use of IRT to score the MBTI inventory makes it \nnearly impossible for a score to land exactly at the midpoint \nof the scale. On the extremely rare occasion when this hap- \npens, a tie-breaker continues to be used with Form M. \n\nOn Form M, all ties are broken in the same direction as with \nprevious forms of the Indicator: l, N, F, or P. \n\nLocating the Division Point \n\nIn Form A, where all items had equal weight, the division \npoint was the point on a scale where half the items were \nanswered for each pole. By definition this point was the \nboundary between people showing one preference and peo- \nple showing the opposite preference. Later, external criteria \nwere employed to help determine the exact location of the \ndivision point. For example, E-l continuous scores were \nregressed onto a rating of gregariousness. Signiftcant changes \nin the level and slope of the regression line helped indicate \nthe location on the E-I continuum that provided maximum \nseparation between Extraverts and Introverts. This and \nother external criteria are reviewed in Chapter 7. \n\nFor Form M, the division point was set based on the results \nof a best-fit type study. For each scale, the location of the \npoint was chosen to maximize agreement between the best- \nfit and the Form M scored preference. \n\nStep Il and Step IIl Scoring Methods \n\nIn the late 1980s, two new scoring methods were developed \nthat have come to be known as Step II and Step III. These \nmethods both include subscales that show facets or a more \nfine-grained structure within the four dichotomous scales. \nThese scoring systems are described in their respective \nmanuals (Saunders, 1987, 1989) and are not covered in the \npresent manual. \n\nSince Form M is a Step I scoring method, that is, it is \nscored only for the four letters of type, it does not include \nany of the subscales. \n\nStandardization Groups \n\nKatharine Briggs and Isabel Briggs Myers first tested tlie ini- \ntial items that became the MBTI on a small criterion group \nof about 20 of their relatives and friends whose type prefer- \nences seemed to them to be clearly evident from a 20-year \nperiod of observing their behavior. As data on the item \nresponses started to accumulate, larger samples were used \nto check or determine item weights in later forms of the \nIndicator. These initial criterion samples mainly included \nadults because adults were expected to have reached higher \nlevels of type development and therefore to be clearer about \ntheir preferences and better able to report them. However, a \n\nA Tradition of Change 13 \n\nsample of studentsthe Swarthmore class of 1943 was \nalso included in the initial criterion groups. Later, addi- \ntional student samples were included. \n\nBetween 1975 and 1977, a new standardization of items \nwas carried out. The new analyses seemed appropriate to \nensure that cultural changes had not decreased the utility of \nitems and to make some minor modifications that. two \ndecades of experience had suggested were desirable. As a \nresult of the analyses of the restandardization, the scoring \nweights for the T-F scale were modified for Form E and a new \nrevision of the Indicator, Form G, was published in 1977. \n\nThe standardization sample for Form M is based on a national \nrepresentative sampling of adults over the age of [8 years. \nThis is the first time that the item weights for the MBTI \ninventory have been based on a large national sampling. The \ncharacteristics of this sample are described in Chapter 7 of \nthis manual. \n\nThe 1998 Revision \n\nAs is evident from the bricf history of the development ol \nthe MBTI inventory outlined above, the instrument has a \nlong tradition of change, adjustment, and refinement. AH of \nthe changes made have been in the service of improving the \npsychometric properties of the instrument while remaining \ntrue to Jungs theory of types. These changes have resulted \nin an instrument that more consistently and correctly iden- \ntifies people's preferences. The 1998 revision of the MBTI \nStep I continues this tradition. \n\nIn this section, we present the rationale for the 1998 \nrevision, followed by the specific goals that provided the \ntargets for the rescarch efforts. The revision process is then \ndescribed, followed by a brief overview of the changes \nmade. \n\nRationale for the Revision \n\nPeople who take the MBTI inventory may make important \nlife decisions based on the results. These results can have a \nsignificant impact on a persons self-understanding and selt- \nesteem. Many current MBTI practitioners, in fact, became \ninterested in the instrument after seeing the positive effect \nan interpretation could have on their clients.

Because of the importance that is \nplaced on the results, it is essential that they be as accurate \nand precise as possible. This was the overarching motiva- \ntion driving all revision activities. Within this context, a \nnumber of events, observations, and research results sug- \ngested that it was time to examine the possibility of making \nsome refinements or improvements to the Indicator. \n\n14 Introduction \n\nCultural Changes Cultural changes over the past 20 years \nindicated that item endorsement rates should be re- \nexamined. The rationale was that such changes might affect \nhow certain words or phrases are interpreted, which might \naffect responses to the items, which in turn might lead to \nchanges in the item weights. Also, the prediction ratios used \nto derive the weights for Form G were based largely on \nsamples of high school and college students, and it was \ndesirable, given that more working adults are taking the \nIndicator, to base weights on a more representative sample. \nIt was also desirable to have various culturally diverse \ngroups reflected in the standardization sample. \n\nCultural changes in the roles of women in society indi- \ncated that the separate weights used to score responses for \nmales and females on the T-F scale should be examined. \nRescarch supported this observation. Harris and Carskadon \n(1988) suggested that the old Form F weights were more \nvalid for men than were the Form G weights. Also, applica- \ntion of IRT-based differential item functioning techniques \n(Greenberg &amp; Harvey, 1993) led the authors to conclude \nthat separate weights were not needed for this scale. \n\nNew Research Research had also shown that the internal \nconsistency reliabilities of the Thinking-Fecling scale were \ntypically among the lowest (Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985), \nsuggesting that the issue of using separate weights on this \nscale needed to be reexamined. Researchers also realized, \nhowever, that the lower reliabilities on this scale might \ninvolve issues of type development as much as issues of \nmeasurement and scoring procedures. \n\nTest-retest reliabilities for whole types were lower than \nhoped for (Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985), although the per- \ncent agreement varies widely across studies. The meta- \nanalysis by Harvey (1996) shows that the agreement across \nall four scales was 36% for studies in which the retest \nperiod was greater than nine'months and 51% for studies in \nwhich the retest period was less than nine months. (Har- \nveys summary was based on Table 10.6, page 173, of the \n1985 Manual.) lt is hypothesized that one reason for the \nlow percent agreement is the possibility of misclassification \naround the midpoints of the separate scales. Note that since \nthe four preferences that constitute a type are measured on \ntour separate scales, only a small percentage of misclassifi- \ncations on each scale can add up across all four scales to \nyicld a lower than desired agreement on whole types. For \nexample, the average test-retest agreement on each of the \nE-1, S-N, I-E and J-P preference scales for periods of less \nthan nine months is 82%, 87%, 82%, and 83%, respectively. \n\nA number of studies have compared reported or MBT! \ntype with best-fit type. Percent agreement in these studies \nranges from 64% to 85%. When there has been disagree- \nment between the type reported by the MBTI and the type \nverified by the individual, it almost always has occurred on \nthose scales on which the person reported only a slight \nprelerence on the instrument. \n\nA review conducted in 1994 of Form J, which contains \nall of the MBTI items developed by Myers, suggested that a \nsmall but potentially significant portion of the items used \nvocabulary that was colloquial or subject to possihle social \ndesirability response sets, particularly for young people. \n\nResearch by Harvey and his colleagues (Harvey &amp; Murry, \n1994; Harvey, Murry, &amp; Markham, 1994) suggested that \nmeasurement error on the MBTI scales may have been par- \nticularly troublesome around the midpoints of the scales, \nwhich would affect test-retest and best-fit type congruencies. \nA study by Thomas and Harvey (1995) suggested that the \naddition of new items to the MBTI item pool may improve \nthe accuracy of the type classifications by increasing the \nprecision around the midpoint when using IRT to seleet \nand score items. \n\nGoals of the 1998 Revision \n\nThe fact remains that the current MBTI forms in use before \nthe revision work as intended, and they work quite well. \nThe data in the 1985 Manual and the review of most of the \nstudies conducted since its publication (reviewed in MBTI \nApplications, Hammer, 1996b) support this conclusion.

The Indicator has been \nused successfully for decades by millions of people. The \ncharacteristics of the instrument that have made it so useful \nto so many for so long should be retained if at all possible. \nThese features include the following: \n\nm A focus on positive, normal, healthy behavior \nB A foundation in the theories of Jung and Myers \nm [he measurement of type as opposed to traits \n\nImproving the Instrument On the other hand, changes in \nculture and language, and advances in survey and test \nconstruction methodologies, suggested that certain \ninnovations might be possible. Therefore, the following \nspecific objectives were targeted for rescarch for the 1998 \nrevision: \n\nB To update item wording and remove outdated language \n\nB To increase the capacity of the instrument to differenti- \nate, particularly around the midpoint of cach scale \n\nM To base the item weights of the MBTI on the responses \nfrom a national representative sample of adults \n\nB To decrease the number of items necessary for determin- \ning a four-letter type \n\nB To improve item-to-scale correlations \n\nM To lower scale intercorrelations \n\nA Tradition of Change 15 \n\nD M MM M   M MM M   M  M99  X  M \n\nB Toeliminate separate gender scoring \n\nEg To minimize the influence of social desirability in re- \nsponses to the items for different age and gender groups \n\nB To remove all items with more than two response options \n\nB lo explore state-of-the-art scoring methodologies con- \nsistent with the above goals \n\nB Toachieve improved validity of predicting verified type \nas an outcome of the hoped-for increased precision \n\nOverview of Changes \n\nThe process used to move toward these goals involved \nmany steps of item writing, item sclection, rescarch with \ndifferent samples, and testing of various item sets. This \nprocess is described in detail in Chapter 7 of this manual. \nHere, however, we will present an overview of the 1998 \nrevision and highlight the changes that resulted in a new \nform of the MBTIForm M. This overview deals primarily \nwith four issues: changes in the wording of the items, item \nselection criteria, changes in the scoring, and changes in the \nstandardization sample. \n\nItem Wording To examine the effect of item language, a \nnumber of items were revised and some new items were \nadded to the tryout pool. The initial pool consisted of the \n290 items from Form J, 200 revised items (Thomas, 19962), \nand an additional 90 items written by two experts in the \ntheory and use of type, making a total of 580 items. \n\nA number of items in this pool were then modified \nbefore testing. Some of the items that had been written in \ntrue/false format were changed to fit the format of MBTI \nitems already in existence. All items with three or more \nresponse options were changed to allow only two response \noptions. Both of these changes were made for consistency \nboth within the item pool and with the theory. \n\nIn revising items or writing new ones, the focus was on \nchanges or additions that the item writers felt would better \nseparate people with particular preferences into the appro- \npriate categories. This emphasis follows the techniques \nused by Myers in her many revisions and changes to the \nitems. The content of a question was only a stimulus to \nevoke a type reaction; it was not determined by require- \nments to provide a specified level of coverage of all of Jungs \nconcepts rclated to that dichotomous preference. Nor were \nthe content areas reflected in the questions meant to cover \nall domains of the preference. The intent was rather to iden- \ntify any clues about preference that would empirically dis- \ntinguish the two groups. The interest in questions was not \nin the superficial behavior reported but in the evidence the \nquestions could provide about the underlying preferences. \n\nWhile this method governed the item-writing phase, \nsome effort was made during ttem selection to ensure that \nthe final set of items did provide good coverage of the \ndomain of that dichotomy, at least as determined by the \nnumber of and the particular subscales covered by the items. \nFor example, the E-1 questions touch on Extraverted and \n\nIntroverted differences in sociability, friendship, intimacy, \ndetachment or involvement, and outspokenness or reserve. \n\nItem Selection Item selection was based on multiple \ncriteria, which are detailed in Chapter 7 of this manual. \nBasically, there were two sets of criteria: theoretical and \nempirical. Theoretical criteria demanded that items be \ncongruent with Jungs and Myers theories of psychological \nopposites. Empirical criteria primarily centered on prediction \nratios and item parameters derived from item response theory \n\nJungs theory of type posits that people make choices",

    "content": "between two opposite ways of perceiving and judging. For \nexample, to function well, a person comes to prefer one of \nthe two opposite ways of perceiving, Sensing or Intuition, \nbecause these two distinct ways of perceiving the world \ncompete for the persons attention (Myers with Myers, \n1980/1995). So, because type theory postulates dichotomies, \nthe tradition of presenting questions in forced-choice format \nwas retained. However, since every person uses all eight of \nthe preferences at different times, if each choice were pre- \nsented separately, both poles could be chosen and one \ncould not know which pole was preferred. \n\nTo be consistent with the forced-choice format, all Form \nJ items that had more than two response options were \neither eliminated or rewritten so that there were only two \nresponse choices. Those two responses that had the greatest \nweights associated with them were retained, as these re- \nsponses did the best job of discriminating between people \nat the opposite poles of the dichotomy. An example of such \nan item is the following: \n\nDoes the idea of making a list of what you should \nget done over the weekend \n\n(A) appeal to you, or \n.B leave you cold, or \n\n(C&gt; positively depress you? \n\nAs illustrated in this example, response (C) was deleted and \nthe item was placed in the initial pool for further testing \nwith only the (A) and (B) responses, which are keyed to the \nJ and P preferences, respectively. \n\nAnother theoretical criterion that was used to guide item \nselection was the need to have the item pool for each scale \nreflect the richness of that preference domain. As the Step H \nscoring of the MBTI demonstrates, each of the four preter- \nence domains can be further subdivided into a number of \nsubscales. Each of the four dichotomies encompasses more \nthan is represented by its five subscalesthe subscales are \nsamples of the greatly more complex preference domain. \nHowever, the subscales do provide a criterion by which the \nrichness of the domain can be measured. Consequently, a \nnumber of items from cach of the 20 subscales of Step II \nwere included in the initial item pool, and subscale coverage \nalso played a role in the final item selection. \n\nTurning to the empirical criteria, the prediction ratio \nmethod was used to first climinate items whose ratios \nfailed to reach the current cutoffs for item weights. These \n\n16 Introduction \n\nwere items for which the ratios for both responses were \nless than .62, which would lead to item weights of 0 lor \nthose responses. An obvious example of such an item is the \nfollowing: \nWhen you have done all you can to remedy a troublesome \nsituation, are you \nA. able to stop worrying about it, or \nB. still more or less haunted by it? \n\nItems for which one of the response weights is 0 do not \nfunction well to differentiate people of opposite preferences. \nAlmost all of these items in fact were never intended to per- \nform this sorting function but rather werc designed to mea- \nsure specific subscales that appcar in the Step II and Step III \nscoring methodologies, as the above example demonstrates \n(from the Worried versus Carefree Comfort/Disconfort scale \nfound in Step III scoring). \n\nItem response theory parameters were also used to select \nitems. Primary considerations were the degree of discrimina- \ntion and the location of the maximum discrimination. The \ndegree of discrimination refers to the probability that the item \nseparates people of opposite preferences into the correct cate- \ngories. Location refers to where on the scale the maximum \nseparation takes place. One of the responses to an item could \nbe answered, for whatever reason, in the same way by almost \neveryone; only a few pcople with very clear preferences on one \nside of the dichotomy would answer it in the opposite direc- \ntion. An example is this item from the Thinking-Feeling scale: \n\nWould you rather work under someone who is \nA) always kind, or \n\nB&gt; always fair? \n\nAlmost everyone, including those with a clear preference \nfor Thinking, chose always kind, which is the response \nkeyed to the Feeling prefcrence. Only a few people who \nreported a very clear preference for Thinking (i.e., those \nwho answered almost every question on the T-F scale in \nthe Thinking direction) responded *always fair.\" Appar- \nently people who very consistently prefer Thinking are will- \ning to put up with a certain amount of unkind bchavior as \nlong as they can be assured that they arc being treated fairly. \nSuch an item is not useful for separating people at the mid- \npoint of the dichotomy and therefore was not selected for \nForm M. \n\nIRT was also used in another way to select items. Using \nan IRT technique called differential item functioning (DIF), \ncach item in the pool was examined to determine whether \ngender or age was significantly related to the response to \nthe item. The DIF method is a powerful technique that can \nhelp determine whether the response to the item is better",

For example, the following item showed \nsignificant gender diflerences: \n\nDo you usually \n(A^ show your feelings freely, or \n(B) keep your feelings to yourself? \n\nWhile people of different preferences (on the E-1 and also \nperhaps on the T-F scale) may respond differently to this \nitem, the different response rates by preference are not as \ngrcat as is thc difference between males and females. This \nitem was therefore eliminated. \n\nElimination of items showing gender differences means \nthat Form M does not require separate weights for males \nand females on the Thinking-Feeling scale, nor on any of \nthe other three scales. This is the first form of the MBTI for \nwhich there is no scparate weighting for males and females \non any of the scales. \n\nAlthough age differences were also examined, not all \nitems showing age DIF were automatically eliminated. The \nitems that did show age differences were generally of two \nkinds. One set included questions that younger respon- \ndents would have trouble answering because they have not \nhad the experience necessary to respond. For example, one \nof the MBTI questions includes the response when run- \nning a business meeting . . . ,\" which is unlikely to be in the \nbehavioral repertoire of an 18-year-old respondent. Another \nexample is this word pair from the E-I scale: \n\nparty (A) CB^ theater \n\nBased on the response data, young people either have little \nidea of what a theater actually is or see this as not a very \nattractive choice when compared with a party. This item \nwas therefore eliminated, as were other such items. \n\nA second set of items showing age DIF were items that \nwere more devclopmental in nature. These primarily \ntended to be items from the J-P scale that asked thc \nrespondent to choose between planning versus acting \nspontaneously. These items were retained (if they met the \nother criteria described in Chapter 7) in order to not elimi- \nnate items that might be sensitive to the devclopment of \npreferences. A possible outcome of this decision is that \ntest-retest reliabilities may be lower, especially over long \nperiods, for younger respondents. \n\nScoring Scoring includes a decision about how to weight \nitems and then how to summarize the responses to the items \niuto an overall indication of preference. Since one of the \nprimary goals of the revision was to improve the clas- \nsification of people around the midpoint of cach scale, \nscoring and weighting schemes were examined for their \ncapacity to increase the precision around the midpoint of \ncach dichotomous scale. Two different approaches to scoring \nwere tested and compared: the prediction ratio method, and \nan approach based on item response theory. For each of these \ntwo approaches, a number of scoring alternatives were \ndevised and tested. To determine which was the better \napproach, a large-scale best-fit type study was conducted. \n\nIsabel Briggs Myers developed the earliest items of the \nIndicator using a select criterion group whose type prefer- \nences were clear enough to be manifest consistently in \nobservable behavior. Purely observational data collected by \nmeans of a small criterion group, while essential to the ini- \ntial stages of a personality assessment and to later valida- \ntion, gave way early in Myers research to larger, heteroge- \nneous samples and to a reliance on determining statistical \nrclationships among these data. However, the fundamental \nobjective of comparing a person's knowledge and aware- \nness of his or her best-fit type against the reported type on \nthe Indicatorand using a sample large enough to yield \nample statistical powerhas been undertaken only in \nrecent years. \n\nThe best-fit type study undertaken to test alternative \nscoring methods involved administering the MBTI to more \nthan 2,400 people nationwide. (Methods and results are \ndescribed in more detail in Chapter 7 of this manual.) In \naddition to responding to the Indicator, each person also \nparticipated in a face-to-face interpretation, either individu- \nally with the interpreter or in a group feedback setting. The \ninterpretations covered the theory of psychological types \nand a description of the preferences. Each person was asked \nto identify the type he or she belicved provided the best fit. \nEach person was also asked to rate, on a scale of I to 5, his \nor her level of confidence in the estimatc. The best-fit type \nestimates were then compared with the types that were \nderived by applying the different scoring procedures to the \nitem responses. \n\nThe results indicated that one of the IRT alternative scor- \ning methods provided the highest percentage of matches \nwith the best-fit type estimates. The sample was divided in \nmany different waysby clarity of preference, age, gender,",

It can be observed in this table that the basic \nfoundations of the MBTI, those characteristics that have \nmade it the most widely used personality test in the world, \nhave not changed. The changes to the instrument are pri- \nmarily technical and were intended to ensure that the mea- \nsurement of type keeps up with and takes advantage of the \nlatest advances in psychometrics and test development. \n\nd \nEA \n $e a wan etfi e^ \nnre Wiles ; \npu Xe cumin t^e TUS jene E \nii gio U bruma T Soper LT \nap oam 7n e *&amp; t, \"4124/78. v maoo cu Watt DI M \nJe p cel 4 \nPet MI 00d: 0 n - Moe and &lt;n Gers a, \nT oP mite gave oe yw tole \n14  E i a g \n \"i cenit \nPE =d \"  M &gt;) ag \" += x, Le \ngri ama ear of apa hee widow. 38: \ny A Tari *: OPs Dus e ben E AERA we Ji \niors p* Wht at  Pot wot Ap er \"0*1. 4 \n5.

As you read Chapter 3, you will become aware \nof the following: \n\nm All of the opposite functions and attitudes are used by \nevery individual at lcast some of the time. \n\nB The JudgingPerceiving dichotomy permits two kinds of \nbalancc in our personalities. \n\nm The theory describes the dynamic ways in which cach \ntype is likely to develop over the life span. \n\nB The environment plays a very important role in the \ndevelopment and expression of type. \n\nm A pcrsons preference for Extraversion or Introversion \nand for Judging or Perceiving enables us to determine \nthe dynamics of her or his type. \n\nB People usually necd a good reason for using a less- \npreferred function or attitude. \n\nIn reading this chapter, you may notice that you find it \neasier to understand and see the value of your own prce- \nferred poles of each dichotomy but that it takes morc effort \nand objectivity to appreciate and value your less-preterred \npersonality parts. You may also recognize as you read that \none or the other pole of cach dichotomy may be more gen- \nerally valued within our culture or other cultures. Aware- \nness of both personal type bias and societal type bias is cen- \ntral to maintaining an objective perspective as you read the \nsecond chapter in Part II. \n\n20 Theory \n\nM  MM  \n\nChapter 4, \"Understanding the 16 Types,\" presents sev- \neral approaches that will help new users begin to under- \nstand the dctails about the types. The chapter also provides \nexperienced users with some new ways of understanding \nand explaining the dynamic aspects of the typology. Read- \ners are shown how to read and use type tables for quick \naccess to group type differences. This is followed by a \ndescription of and rationale for the precise terminology \nneeded to describe different type groupings. The remainder \nof the chapter identifies, describes, and provides supporting \nresearch for groupings of types that consist of specific two- \nletter combinations. The 16 full type descriptions and sup- \nporting research summaries complete Chapter 4. As you \nread Chapter 4 you will become aware of the following: \n\nB There is a difference between, for example, dominant \nintroverted Sensing types (IST] and ISFJ) and Introverts \nwith Sensing (IST], ISFJ, ISTP, and ISFP). \n\nB A good deal of research has been conducted with some \ngroupings of types and very little with others. \n\nB [he workplace accommodates the values and goals \nof some types more readily than it does those of other \ntypes. \n\nm Different types find different aspects of life more and \nless stressful and cope with perceived stresses in type- \nconsistent ways. \n\nB Asscssing the 16 types from a single-norm perspective \nleads to some positive-seeming and negative-sceming \nresearch results. \n\nm When we evaluate research, we must be careful to avoid \nfalling into a \"trait perspective\" that makes some types \nlook \"better\" than others. \n\nMuch material is covered in Chapter 4, and it varies in \ncomplexity. For newcomers to type, keeping type dynamics \naccurately in mind takes practice and repctition. They may \nfind it difficult to fully absorb some of the information in \nthis chapter. These readers might find it useful to revisit the \nchapter after they become more experienced and comfort- \nable with the language and concepts of type. \n\nThe Theory Behind the MBTI \n\nA Brief History of Type Theory \nThe Four Functions \n\nThe Four Attitudes or Orientations \nTheTheory of Type Development \n\nThe Dynamic Interaction \nof the Preferences \n\nConclusion \n\nvery individual is unique.

The doctrine of uniqueness, how- \never, gives no practical help in understanding the people \nwhom we must educate, counsel, work with, or interact \nwith in our personal lives. \n\n[n practice we tend to assume unconsciously that other \npeoples minds work on the same principles as our own. All \ntoo often, however, the people with whom we interact do \nnot reason as we reason, do not value the things we value, \nor are not interested in what interests us. The assumption of \nsimilarity, therefore, can promote misunderstanding of the \nmotives and behaviors of people whose minds operate quite \ndifferently from our own. \n\nThe value of the theory underlying the Myers-Briggs \nType Indicator personality inventory is that it enables us to \nexpect specific differences in specific people and to cope \nwith people and their dilferences more constructively than \nwe otherwise could. Briefly, the theory is that much seem- \ningly chance variation in human behavior in fact is not due \nto chance; it is the logical result of a few basic, observable \npreferences. \n\nIn developing the Indicator, Isabel Myers primary aim \nwas to give individuals access to the benefits of knowing \ntheir personality type. A secondary and vital goal was to \nvalidate C. G. Jungs theory of psychological types (Jung, \n1921/1971) and to put it to practical use. Jungian theory \nwas taken into account in every question and in every step \nof development of the MBTI instrument. Details of the \nresearch leading up to the development of Form M are \ndescribed in Chapter 7. The MBTI theory is explained in \ndetail in Gifts Differing (Myers with Myers, 1980/1995), a \n\n21 \n\n22 Theory \n\nbasic reference for all who plan to use the MBTI, The \ndynamic and developmental nature of the theory is further \nexplicated in Introduction to: Type Dynamics and Develop- \nment (Myers &amp; Kirby, 1994) and in other works that focus \non specific aspects of dynamics and development (Corlett \n&amp; Millner, 1993; Quenk, 1993). \n\nA Brief History of Type Theory \n\nWhen the term type theory is used in this manual, it refers to \nJungs theory as interpreted by Isabel Myers and Katharine \nBriggs in the MBT! personality inventory. Jungian type the- \nory was developed over a period of many years. Jung gradu- \nally refined the descriptive elements of the system and the \ndynamic interactions of the elements. Myers and Briggs fur- \nther refined the approach in providing detailed, neutral \ndescriptions of the types as well as in clarifying the rationale \nunderlying the dynamic interactions hypothesized. \n\nJungs Initial Focus \non Extraversion and Introversion \n\nJungs attempt to explain individual differences in personal- \nity initially stemmed from his observation that there were \ntwo types of people, extraverts and introverts. He described \nextraverts as those whose energies are primarily oriented \noutwardly toward people and events in their external envi- \nronment and introverts as those whose energies are directed \ninwardly toward thoughts and experiences in their inner \nenvironment. His identification of these two types led to the \ndetailed and broad-ranging descriptions of extraversion and \nintroversion that he later described in Psychological Types \n(1921/1971). Jung saw extraversion and introversion as \ntwo different attitudes, with the term attitude defined as a \nreadiness of the psyche to act or react in a certain way ... \nhaving an attitude is synonymous with an a priori orienta- \ntion to a definite thing\" (1921/1971, p. 414).! About 10 \nyears after his initial studies of extraversion and introver- \nsion, Jung noted that these two types did not provide a \ncomplete picture of what he observed. He stated, \n\nWhat struck me now was the undeniable fact [that] while peo- \nple may be elassed as introverts or extraverts, this does not \naccount for the tremendous differences between individuals in \neither class. So great, indeed, are these differences that I was \nforced to doubt whether | had observed correctly in the first \nplace. It took nearly ten years of observation and comparison \nto clear up this doubt. (1921/1971, p. 535) \n\nThe Addition of the Four Functions \n\nDuring those 10 years, Jung subdivided his initial extravert \nand introvert types into eight types by identifying two pairs \nof opposite mental functions: two opposite perceiving func- \ntions, sensation Cealled Sensing by Myers and Briggs) versus \n\nintuition; and two opposite judging functions, thinking ver- \nsus fecling.* As stated in Chapter 1, perceiving refers to the \ngathering of information, and judging refers to the manner \nwith which we come to conclusions about what we perceive. \nThe specific meaning of each of these functions will be dis- \ncussed later in this chapter. Jung defined a function as ^a par- \nticular form of psyehie activity that remains the same in prin- \nciple under varying conditions\" ( Jung, 1921/1971, p. 436).",

    "content": "following discussion focuses on the four dichotomies of thc \nMBTI. \n\nThe Four Functions \n\nThe essence of Jungs comprehensive theory of type is that \neveryone uscs four basic mental functions, or processes, that \nare called Sensing (S), Intuition (N), Thinking (T), and Fecl- \ning (F). These four functions are essential for daily living. \nThe 16 types differ in the priorities given to cach function \nand in the attitudes of Extraversion (E) and Introversion (I) \nin which they typically use each function. These differences \nin priorities and attitudes of energy (E or I) account for the \ndifferent interactions among the functions that occur in each \nof the 16 types. This and the next chapter describe the dis- \ntinctive dynamics and development of each type. \n\nThe four functions postulated by JungSensing, Intu- \nition, Thinking, and Feelingrepresent functions as they \nare related to consciousness. This means that any one of the \nfour functions can be conscious in a particular individual. \nThe function that is most conscious or dominant, that is, \nthat has the greatest amount of conscious energy at its com- \nmand, determines the degree of consciousness of the other \nthree. For example, if Sensing is the dominant, most con- \nscious function, the opposite, Intuition, will be the least \nconscious. Thinking and Feeling will be somewhere be- \ntween Sensing and Intuition in available energy. The same \nprinciple applies when Intuition, Thinking, or Fecling has \nthe largest share of psychological energy or attention. \n\nJungs concept of the four functions grew from his \nempirical observations over many years: Jung concluded, I \ndistinguish these functions from one another because they \ncannot be related or reduced to one another\" (1921/I971, \n\n24 Theory \n\np. 437). Type theory assumes, therefore, that many aspects \nof conscious mental activity can be subsumed under one of \nthese four categories. \n\nUse of the Terms Perception and Judgment \n\nTo understand Jungs theory it is important to appreciate the \nuses of the terms perception and judgment. \n\nPerception means all the ways of becoming aware of \nthings, people, events, or ideas. It includes information \ngathering, the seeking of sensation or of inspiration, and \nthe selection of a stimulus to attend to. \n\nJudgment means all the ways of coming to conclusions \nabout what has been perceived. It includes evaluation, \nchoice, decision making, and the selection of a response \nafter perceiving a stimulus. \n\nTwo Kinds of Perception: \nSensing (S) and Intuition (N) \n\nJung divided all perceiving activities into two categories \nsensation and intuition. He called these irrational functions, \nby which he meant that they are attuned to the flow of \nevents and operate most broadly when not constrained by \nrational direction. Freely experiencing a flood of sensations \nwith no attempt to limit or select amongst them is an illus- \ntration of sensing as an irrational function. During such a \nstate of free receptivity, sensations flow freely with no \nattempt to evaluate them. The technique of brainstorming \nillustrates intuition in the irrational sense. During brain- \nstorming, inspirations are encouraged to flow freely, with- \nout the constraint of criticism or appraisal. \n\nSensing (S) Sensing refers to perceptions observable by way \nof the senses. Sensing establishes what exists. Because the \nsenses can bring to awareness only what is occurring in the \npresent moment, persons orierited toward Sensing tend to \nlocus on the immediate experiences available to their five \nsenses. They therefore often develop characteristics \nassociated with this awareness, such as enjoyment of the \npresent moment, realism, acute powers ol observation, \nmemory for the dctails of both past and present experiences, \nand practicality. Persons oriented to Sensing may become so \nintent on observing and experiencing the present moment \nthat they do not sufficiently attend to future possibilities. \n\nIntuition (N) Intuition refers to perception of possibilities, \nincanings, and relationships by way of insight. Jung char- \nacterized intuition as perception by way of the unconscious. \nIntuition may come to the surface of consciousness as a \nhunch or as a sudden discovery of a pattern in seemingly \nunrelated events. Intuition permits pereeption beyond what \nis visible to the senses, including possible future events. \nPeople who prefer Intuition may develop the characteristics \nthat can follow from that emphasis and become imagina- \ntive, theoretical, abstract, future oriented, and original or \ncreative. Persons oriented toward Intuition may also \n\nbecome so intent on pursuing possibilities that they \noverlook actualities. \n\nAn Example of Sensing Versus Intuition The difference \nbetween the two perceiving functions can be illustrated by \nthe example of an apple. When the Sensing function is used \nto perceive an apple, a person might describe it as juicy, \ncrisp, red, or white with black seeds. The focus is on",

The focus of attention of Thinking \njudgment is on the Sensing or Intuitive information relevant \nto making the particular decision at hand. Thinking \njudgment relies on impartiality and neutrality with respect to \nthe personal desires and values of both the decision maker \nand the people who may be affected by the decision. Persons \nwho are primarily oriented toward Thinking are likely to \ndevelop characteristics associated with this way of arriving at \nconclusions: analytical inclination, objectivity, concern with \nprinciples of justice and fairness, criticality, an impassive and \ndispassionate demeanor, and an orientation to time that is \nlinear, that is, concerned with connections from the past \nthrough the present and toward the future. \n\nFeeling Judgment (F) Feeling is the function by which one \ncomes to decisions by weighing relative values and merits of \nthe issues. Feeling relies on an understanding of personal \nvalues and group values; thus itis more subjective than \nThinking. Nevertheless, Feeling, like thinking, is a rational \nfunction, since values in general are assigned according to \nthe laws of reason\" (Jung, 1921/1971, p. 435). Because \nvalues are subjective and personal, persons making \njudgments with the Feeling function are more likely to be \nattuned to the values and feelings of others as well as to \ntheir own values and feelings. They try to understand \n\npeople and to anticipate and take into account the effects of \nthe decision at hand on the people involved and on what is \nimportant to them. They have a concern with the human as \nopposed to the technical aspects of problems, a desire for \naffiliation, warmth, and harmony, and a time orientation \nthat includes preservation of enduring values. The focus on \nsubjective values renders the process of making a Feeling \njudgment less directly observable than the linear, logical \nprocess of making a Thinking judgment. As a result, Feeling \ntypes may be at a disadvantage when asked to \"justify\" their \njudgments from the point of view of logic alone. \n\nAhhough the classical distinction in psychology between \n\"tough-minded\" and \"tender-minded\" people is one aspect \nof the T-F difference, it does not follow that \"thinking\" \npeople do not have \"feelings\" or that feeling people can- \nnot follow a logical argument. Such erroneous views reflect \ntwo of the common misconceptions about people who \nfavor one or the other of the two judging functions. Equat- \ning Feeling as a decision-making process with feeling as \naffect or emotion is also a common misperception. In this \nregard, Jung stated, Feeling is distinguishable from affect \nby the fact that it produces no perceptible physical innerva- \ntions, i.e., neither more nor less than an ordinary thinking \nprocess\" (1921/1971, p. 434). \n\nAn Example of Thinking Versus Feeling Decision Making \nAn example of the difference between using Thinking \njudgment and using Feeling judgment is the following: \n\nIn making a decision about which of five employees \nshould be promoted to a supervisory position, the Thinking \ndecision process would very likely involve developing a set \nof explicit criteria, ranking the criteria relative to their \nimportance to the decision, and rating each of the five \nemployees accordingly. After deciding which candidate or \ncandidates best met the criteria, a Thinking type might or \nmight not use the less-preferred Feeling function to consider \nother factors such as personal style, acceptability to other \nemployees, and the employees personal circumstances. \nSuch considerations might aid decision making when a \nchoice must be made between equally logical alternatives. \nAttending to these more subjective issues might also allow \nthe decision maker to see whether any of these factors \nmight have a significant negative impact on the logical \nchoice.",

If all functions exerted \nequal weight, the personality would be at cross-purposes, \nlacking in consistent direction. To compare a personality to \na ship at sca, we take it for granted that a ship needs a cap- \ntain with undisputed authority to set the course and bring \nthe ship safely to port. The ship would never reach its desti- \nnation if each person at the helm in turn aimed at a different \ndestination and altered course accordingly. In type theory, \none of the four functions is the favorite, or dominant, func- \ntion. This dominant function serves as the captain of the \npersonality. It determines what is the necessary direction to \nreach the desired destination and keeps the ship on \ncourse. The other functions are important but are subordi- \nnate to and serve the goals of the dominant function. \n\nIn Jungian terms, the dominant function has the largest \nshare of the available psychic energy under its control. In \nthe hierarchy of the functions, the auxiliary, tertiary, and \ninferior functions have proportionally less energy available \nthat the individual can direct and control. \n\nThe Four Attitudes or Orientations \n\nUnderstanding the way in which the dominant and other \nfunctions interrelate in cach type requires an explanation of \nthe Extraversion-Introversion (E-I) and Judging-Perceiving \n( J-P) dichotomies, the two pairs of attitudes or orientations \nin type theory. This section explains these dichotomies. \n\nTwo Kinds of Energy \nExtraversion and Introversion \n\nA major portion of Jungs Psychological Types (1921/1971) is \ndevoted to the historical development and description of the \nconcepts of extraversion and introversion. These are scen as \ncomplementary attitudes or orientations of energy. The \nnature and extent of differences between extraversion and \nintroversion translate into profoundly different approaches \nto or orientations toward life. \n\n26 Iheory \n\nThe Extraverted Attitude (E) In the Extraverted attitude, \nenergy and attention flow out, or are drawn out, to the \nobjects and people in the environment. The individual \nexperiences a desire to act on the environment, to affirm its \nimportance, to increase its effect. Persons habitually taking \nthe Extraverted attitude may develop some or all of the \ncharacteristics associated with Extraversion: awareness of \nand reliance on the environment for stimulation and \nguidance; an eagerness to interact with the outer world; an \naction-oriented, sometimes impulsive way of meeting life; \nopenness to new experiences; ease of communication and \nsociability; and a desire to talk things out. \n\nThe Introverted Attitude (l) In the Introverted attitude, \nenergy is drawn from the environment toward inner \nexperience and reflection. One desires to stay focused on the \ninternal, subjective state, to affirm its value, and to maintain \nthis focus as long as possible. The main interests of the \nIntroverted type are in the world of concepts, ideas, and \ninner experiences. Persons habitually taking the Introverted \nattitude may develop some or all of the characteristics \nassociated with Introversion: interest in the clarity of \nconcepts, ideas, and recollected experience; reliance on \nenduring concepts and experiences more than on transitory \nexternal events or fleeting ideas; a thoughtful, contemplative \ndetachment; an enjoyment of solitude and privacy; and a \ndesire to think things out before talking about them. \n\nTo many laypeople, the term extraverted means sociable,",

Seen as differ- \nent orientations of energy, a preference for Extraversion or \nIntroversion identifies the direction in which a persons \nenergies typically flow, outward or inward. Extraverts are \nseen as having more energy directed toward the outer \nworld, with correspondingly less energy available for inner \nactivities. Introverts are seen as, having more energy directed \ntoward the inner world, with correspondingly less energy \navailable for activities in the outer world. The comfort with \nand amount of time devoted to each orientation of energy \nby individuals results in two recognizable variants of nor- \nmal human personalityExtraverts and Introverts. These \ntypes of people have been recognized throughout history \nand literature, each making major contributions to society. \nMyers descriptions of Extraverts and Introverts reflect the \ncomplex, multifaceted nature of Jungs conception. \n\nTwo Attitudes or Orientations to the \nOuter WorldJudging (J) and Perceiving (P) \n\nNo explicit mention is made by Jung regarding a judging \nversus perceiving attitude? or orientation toward the outer- \nworld. Katharine Briggs described such a type classification. \nin her unpublished work prior to the publication of Jungs \nwork. She observed that some people habitually use judg- \nment in interacting with the outer, extraverted world, being \nlikely to come to conclusions and achieve closure quickly. \n\nThese people were identified later by Myers and Briggs as \npeople with a Judging attitude. Briggs described other peo- \nple as habitually interacting with the outer world using per- \nceiving, liking to continue gathering information as long as \npossible before comfortably coming to closure. These peo- \nple were identified later as having a Perceiving attitude. \nKatharine Briggs' work in conjunction with Jungs incom- \nplete discussion of this area formed the basis for the J-P for- \nmulation used in the MBTI. \n\nThe J-P dichotomy has two uses. First, in conjunction \nwith the E-I dichotomy, it is used to identify which of the \ntwo preferred functions is the leading or dominant function \nand which is the auxiliary function. Second, it describes \nidentifiable attitudes or orientations to the outer world. The \nrecognition and development of the character of the J-P \ndichotomy are a major contribution of Briggs and Myers to \nthe theory of psychological types. \n\nThe concept of the J-P attitude was derived over a period \nof several decades, before any MBTI items were written. \nMyers observation ol different behavioral patterns formed \nthe basis for the J-P distinction. Behaviors characteristic of \npersons who used either Thinking or Feeling in their outer \nlife (i.e., who extraverted one of the judgment functions) \nformed the basis for the Judging pole of the J-P dichotomy. \nBehaviors characteristic of persons who used either Sensing \nor Intuition in their outer life (i.e., who extraverted a per- \nceiving function) formed the basis of the Perceiving pole of \nthe J-P dichotomy. One of the most overloohed characteristics \nof the J-P dichotomy is that it describes the orientation to the \nouter or extraverted world for every type. Others readily \nnotice how people behave in the outer world and, as a result, \noften recognize someone as having a Judging or a Perceiving \nattitude relatively early on in the acquaintance. \n\nIn any new activity, it is appropriate first to use a perceiv- \ning function (S or N) to observe or take in the situation; then \nit is appropriate to use a judging function (T or F) to decide \non the appropriate action. Perceiving types typically remain \nlonger in the observing attitude because it is more comfort- \nable and natural for them. Judging types move more quickly \nthrough perception in order to reach conclusions and achieve \nclosure, as they are most comfortable and satisfied when a \nplan has been developed or when a decision has been made. \n\nThe Judging Attitude (J) In the Judging attitude, a person \nis concerned with making decisions, seeking closure, \nplanning operations, or organizing activities. For Thinking \nJudging (TJ) types, the decisions and plans are more likely \nto be based on logical analysis; for Feeling Judging (FJ) \ntypes, the decisions and plans are more likely to be based on \nweighing and assessing values. But for both TJ and FJ \npeople, who characteristically live in the Judging (J) \nattitude, perception tends to be shut off as soon as they have \nobserved enough to make a decision. In contrast, people \nwho prefer the Perceiving attitude will often suspend \njudgment to take another look, reporting, We don't know \nenough yet to make a decision. People who prefer Judging \n\noften seem in their outer behavior to be organized, \npurposeful, and decisive, frequently stating, Yes, we do \nhave enough information to make this decision.\" \n\nProcrastination can be the result of perception with a",

It is also important to distin- \nguish between a preference for using a Perceiving function \nin the outer world (P) and perceptiveness. Just as ] types \nshould not be assumed to be judgmental, P types should \nnot be assumed to be especially discerning. \n\nA source of confusion for many people learning about \nthe MBTI is the fact that Judging includes both Thinking \nand Feeling and Perceiving includes both Sensing and Intu- \nition. Figure 3.1 shows this relationship. \n\nThe Perceiving Attitude (P) In the Perceiving attitude, a \nperson is attuned to incoming information. For Sensing \nPerceiving (SP) types the information is more likely to be the \nimmediate realities in the environment, what is happening \nand is observable. For Intuitive Perceiving (NP) types the \ninformation is more likely to be new ideas, interesting \npatterns, and future possibilities. But for both SP and NP \ntypes, the Perceiving attitude is open, curious, and interested. \nPersons who characteristically live in the Perceiving attitude \nseem in their outer behavior to be spontaneous, curious, \nadaptable, and open to what is new and changeable. Their \naim is to receive information as long as possible in an effort to \nmiss nothing that might be important. \n\nTheTheory of Type Development \n\nAn important aspect of Jungs type theory is its focus on the \ndevelopment of personality throughout the life span. There \nis a hierarchy of functions that describes an individuals per- \nsonality at any stage of life. This hierarchy of dominant, aux- \niliary, tertiary, and inferior functions permits and encourages \nthe kind of development and adaptation that is likely to be \nmost useful for an individual at each stage of life. \n\nType Development During Childhood \n\nType theory assumes that children are born with a predispo- \nsition to prefer some functions to others. Children are most \ninterested in their preferred functions. They are motivated to \nexercise their dominant function and to a somewhat lesser \nextent their auxiliary function, becoming more skillful, \nadept, and differentiated in their use. Jung described a differ- \nentiated function as one that is separate and exists by itself, \nso that it can operate on its own without being mixed up \n\nThe Theory Behind the MBTI 27 \n\nJudging (J) Perceiving (P) \nThinking Feeling Sensing Intuition \n\nFigure 3.1 The J-P Dichotomy \n\nSource.

A \nsense af competence comes from exercising a function well, \nand with the reinforcement of constant practice these func- \ntions become more controlled and trustworthy. The pleasure \nof using preferred functions generalizes to other activities \nrequiring use of the functions and leads to the surface traits, \nbehaviors, and skills associated with these functions. \n\nWhile this development of preferred functions is occur- \nring, there is relative neglect of the opposite functions. In \nthis sequence of events, for example, a child who prefers \nSensing perception and a child who prefers Intuitive per- \nception will develop along divergent lines. Each will \nbecome relatively differentiated in an area in which the \nother remains undifferentiated. Both channel their interests \nand energies into activities that give them a chance to use \ntheir minds in the ways they prefer, and each acquires a set \nof surface traits that grows out of the basic preferences. \n\nType Development During \nAdolescence and Adulthood \n\nAsa child becomes an adolescent and then an adult, contin- \nued exercise of the dominant and auxiliary functions pro- \nmotes further enjoyment, development, and differentiation \nof them as compared with their opposite inferior and ter- \ntiary functions. For example, a person who develops Sens- \ning in a highly differentiated way is likely to become an \nastute observer of the immediate environment. In the \nprocess, the person acquires some of the characteristics \nassumed to follow from this acute awareness: realism, prac- \nticality, and common sense. While paying attention to thc \nspecifics of the environment, the person spends less time \nand energy using Intuition, which is the perceiving func- \ntion opposite to Sensing. Focusing on the present (S) gives \npeople who prefer the Sensing function less time for focus- \ning on the future (N); focusing on the concrete (S) gives \nthem less energy for focusing on the abstract (N); focusing \non practical applications (S) gives them less interest in the-",

For each type, two ol the four functions \n\n28 Theory \n\nare assumed to be more interesting and more likely to be \nconsciously developed and used. The two less-preferred \nfunctions are assumed to be less interesting and are likely to \nbe relatively neglected. Development comes from striving \nfor excellence in those functions that hold the greatest \ninterest and from becoming at least passable in the other \nless interesting but essential functions. \n\nIn youth and adulthood, the task is to develop the first \n(leading, or dominant) and the second (auxiliary) functions. \nThe theory assumes that these innate, natural functions are \nbest suited to helping a person find a comfortable and effec- \ntive place in the worldthe task of youth and adulthood. \n\"Specializing\" by devoting a great deal of energy to ones \ndominant and auxiliary functions is therefore appropriate \nduring the first half of life. During midlife, people appear to \nbe naturally motivated toward completing their personali- \nties through gradually adding the previously neglected ter- \ntiary and inferior functions to the sphere of operation. In \nthe second half of life, it is appropriate to be a generalist \nrather than a specialist. Development of this kind allows \nindividuals to add new perspectives and experiences that \nwere previously not very fulfilling to them. Giving greater \nenergy and attention to the tertiary and inferior functions \ninvolves a corresponding lessening of energy and attention \nto the dominant and auxiliary functions. However, this \ndoes not involve a change in a person's type. Type theory \nassumes that type does not change over the life span. Rather, \nthe expression of type may vary in accordance with differ- \nent stages of life and different life circumstances. \n\nA very few exceptional persons may reach a stage of \ndevelopment at which they can use each function relatively \neasily as the situation requires. For most people, however, \nstriving for a comfortable and effective expression of the \nfour mental functions is an interesting and challenging life- \nlong process, with no expectation that a person will arrive \nata predetermined level of development. \n\nInfluence of the Environment \non Type Development \n\nIn the type model, environment becomes extremely impor- \ntant because it can foster development of each persons nat- \nural preferences, or it can discourage them by reinforcing \nactivities that are less satisfying, less comfortable, and less \nmotivating. The latter situation makes it difficult to acquire \nconfidence and skill in ones natural preferences. In fact, \nenvironmental interference with type development can dis- \ntort or suppress a persons natural, innate type. Individuals \nto whom this occurs may become skillful in using an ini- \ntially less-preferred function but may also be less content, \nmay feel less competent, or may be out of touch with their \nown best gifts. The MBTI does not necessarily reveal the \nextent to which natural development has been fostered or \nthwarted. Chapters 5 and 6 will discuss some of the strate- \ngies for helping individuals identify their true preferences. \n\nRationale for a Type Development Theory \n\nSome people dislike the idea of a dominant function and \nprefer to think of themselves as using all the functions \nequally. Others strive for equal development of the func- \ntions, erroneously believing this to be necessary or desir- \nable. Jung said that when energy is shared equally between \ntwo opposite mental functions, differentiation cannot occur. \nBoth functions remain undeveloped, which produces an \nunconscious primitive mentality\" in which neither func- \ntion can be directed and controlled. When a person tries to \nattend to two incompatible opposites at the same time, they \njam each other and no clear signal comes through. For \nexample, a person who is pulled equally toward Sensing \nand Intuition might focus on concrete facts in the present, \nmove quickly to future possibilities, switch to an entirely \ndifferent set of facts, and so on. Persistent vacillation among \nperceiving functions would very likely produce confusion \nand frustration for the individual. At the point at which a \ndecision needs to be made based on available information, \nSensing facts and Intuitive possibilities may be indistin- \nguishable from one another. Thus, if either one of a pair of \nfunctions is to develop, the other must be shut off most of \nthe time to give the person a chance to gain experience and \nconfidence in the natural, preferred function. \n\nIn Jungian typology, therefore, optimum use of the four \nfunctions is to be obtained not through equality but rather",

Support for \nuniversality comes from the fact that many translations of \nthe MBTI are being used successfully and many more are \nbeing developed. Users in other countries and cultures \nreport excellent results in applying personality type con- \ncepts. All four dichotomies and all 16 types are recognized \nin other countries and cultures. However, the way the \nopposite preferences in each dichotomy are expressed in \nother cultures may vary considerably from the way they are \nexpressed in U.S. culture. A discussion of this and related \nissues regarding the universality of type can be found in \nChapter 14. \n\nThe Dynamic Interaction \nof the Preferences \n\nWhen people respond to the items on the MBTI assessment \ntool, thev are not only casting votes for Extraversion (E) or \nIntroversion (1), Sensing (S) or Intuition (N), Thinking (T) \nor Feeling (F), and Judging (J) or Perceiving (P); they are \nalso providing the information needed to form  hypothesis \nabout their type dynamics. Each four-letter type stands for a \ncomplex set of dynamic relationships among the functions \n(S, N, T, and F), the attitudes (E and D), and the attitude or \norientation to the outer world (J and P).

He \nfirst (1921/1971) described eight preference types, focus- \ning on the dominant function of each and the attitude (E \nor I) in which the dominant function was typically used. \nJung described but did not go into great detail concerning \nthe need for a secondary function whose nature is differ- \nent from, but not antagonistic to, the primary function\" \n(Jung, 1921/1971, p. 406). According to Jung, every type \nhas an auxiliary function which is in every respect differ- \nent from the nature of the primary function.\" From these \nstatements, Myers and Briggs reasoned that the auxiliary \nfunction is oriented to the less-preferred attitude. Indeed, \nthere are several references in Jungs writing to the three \nremaining functions having an opposite attitudinal charac- \nter. For example, in writing about introverts with thinking \ndominant (p. 387), Jung commented that the counterbal- \nancing functions (that is, auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior \nfunctions) have an extraverted character. Myers and Briggs \ntherefore assumed the following: \n\nThe Theory Behind the MBTI 29 \n\nBM For each type, one function will lead, or be dominant. \nThis is the first function. \n\nB Members of each type will mainly use their first function \nin their favorite attitude. That is, Extraverts use the first \nfunction mainly in the outer world of Extraversion; \nIntroverts use the first function mainly in the introverted \nworld of concepts, ideas, and inner experience. \n\nB In addition to the first, or dominant, function, a second, \nor auxiliary, function will be developed to provide balance. \n\nB The auxiliary function provides balance between Extra- \nversion and Introversion. For Extraverts, the first, or \ndominant, function will be extraverted, and the second, \nor auxiliary, function will typically be used in the inner \nworld.

It follows, therefore, \nthat Introverts are more likely to be underestimated in \ncasual contacts. \n\nThe fact that the second function provides balance \nbetween Extraversion and Introversion also provides a \ncorrection to a common misconception by persons new to \ntype theory. Extraverts may assume that type theory says \nthey never like to be alone, and Introverts may assume \nthat type theory says they never like to be sociable. Type \ntheory, however, assumes that everyone lives in both the \nextraverted and introverted worlds to some extent. Many \npeople attain comfort and competence in both worlds, but \nfor each person, one attitude is preferred over the other. A \nwell-developed Introvert can deal ably with the extraverted \nworld when necessary but works best, most easily, and with \nless fatigue when concentrating on concepts or inner \nexperience. A similarly well-developed Extravert can deal \neffectively with concepts or inner experience but works \nwith most interest, satisfaction, and energy externally in \naction. Good type development fosters the ability to \nextravert comfortably and to introvert comfortably but \nalso assumes a clear and natural preference for one atti- \ntude or the other. \n\nB The auxiliary function also provides balance between \nperception and judgment. As specified by Jung, if the \nfirst function is a perceiving function (S or N), the sec- \nond function will be a judging function (T or F). Or, if \nthe first function is a judging function (T or F), the sec- \nond function will be a perceiving function (S or N). \nWhen using the auxiliary function effectively, a person gains \ncommand of both perception and judgment, that is, of tak- \ning in information and making decisions. \n\n30 Theory \n\nm The J-P dichotomy, as noted earlier, points to the function \nused in the extraverted attitude, for both Extraverts and \nIntroverts. \n\nm The function opposed to the dominant function is typi- \ncally the least-developed, or inferior, function. It can also \nbe referred to as the fourth function. The inferior func- \ntion tends to be used in the less-preferred attitude of \nExtraversion or Introversion. \n\ng The function opposite to the auxiliary function is the ter- \ntiary, or third, function. Several views regarding the atti- \ntude typically used by the tertiary function have been pro- \nposed. For the purposes of exposition and consistency \nwith the 1985 Manual, we will assume that the dominant \nfunction operates in the preferred attitude and that the \nauxiliary, tertiary, and inferior functions all take the oppo- \nsite, less-preferred attitude. Jungians themselves do not \nagree about some specifics of Jungs psychological type \ntheory, particularly in relation to the orientation of the \nauxiliary function as identified by the J-P dichotomy. \n\nThese assumptions make it possible to use the type let- \nters to identify the first (dominant), second (auxiliary), \nthird (tertiary), and fourth (inferior) functions and their \ntypical attitudes for each of the 16 types. \n\nIdentifying the Dynamics of Each Type \n\nThe four letters of type show the preference order (see also \nTable3.2). \n\nFirst letter: preference for the Extraverted (E) or Intro- \nverted (1) attitude of energy \n\nSecond letter: preference for Sensing (S) or Intuitive \n(N) perception \n\nThird letter: preference for Thinking (T) or Feeling (F) \njudgment \n\nFourth letter: preference for a Judging (J) or Perceiving \n(P) attitude toward the outer, extraverted world \n\nRemember that for any type, the middle two letters iden- \ntify the dominant and auxiliary functions. The following sec- \ntion presents a straightforward way to determine the dynam- \nics of type for any four-letter type. \n\nSteps for Identifying \nthe Hierarchy of Functions \n\nStep |: The first step is to look at the last letter of the type, J \nor P. It will tell us whether a judging function (T or F) ora \nperceiving function (S or N) is typically extraverted in that \ntype. For example, for EST], the J shows that the judging \nfunction is extraverted. The judging function preferred by \nan EST] is Thinking. The J in the formula points to Think- \ning as the extraverted function for EST]. As a reminder of \nthis fact, we put a small  beside the T in EST]. \n\nEST, | \n\nTable 3.2 Positions of the Preferences \n\nE-I S-N T-F J-P \nPerceiving Judging \n\nAttitudes Functions Functions Attitudes \n\nExtraversion or Sensing or Thinking or Judging or \n\nIntroversion Intuition Feeling Perceiving \n\nStep 2: For the second step, we remember that in type",

The remaining middle letter is S, so 5 \nmust be the introverted function. As a reminder, we put a \nsmall , beside the S. \n\n3 \nThe type can now be shown as follows: \n\nESTE] \n\nStep 3: For the third step, we remember that the first letter \ntells us which attitude is preferred and thus the attitude in \nwhich the types dominant function is used. We therefore \nlook at the first letter of the type. We see that for ES,Tg]J it \nis E. It tells us that EST] extraverts the dominant function. \n\nStep 4: The fourth step looks at the function that has an g \nbeside it. For ES(TpJ it is T. We can now match that p with \nthe first letter, E. This match tells us that the dominant \nfunction of ES(Tr] is T, Thinking. \n\nStep 5: We identify the auxiliary function by defaultit is \nthe other middle letter, Sj, Sensing, and the small , beside it \nreminds us that it is introverted. \n\nTo complete the dynamics of EST], we turn our attention \nto the two type function letters that do not appear in the \ntypeN and E We know that one of these will be the ter- \ntiary function and the other the inferior function. Two sim- \nple rules are all that is needed: The tertiary function is oppo- \nsite to the auxiliary function, and the inferior function is \nopposite to the dominant function. Therefore, for EST]: \n\nN (Intuition) is the tertiary function. Following the con- \nvention in the 1985 Manual, we specily its attitude as intro- \nverted, the same as for the auxiliary function. \n\nF (Feeling) is the inferior function. The inferior function \ntakes the attitude opposite to the dominant function.

The opposite \nof dominant introverted Fecling is inferior extraverted Thinking. \n\nUnderstanding the Dynamics \nof the Type Description \n\nOnce the principles and mechanical steps are grasped, one \ncan figure out the type dynamics for all of the 16 types. \nTable 3.3 shows the priorities and directions of the four \nfunctions for each of the 16 types. When the hierarchy of \nfunctions has been determined, the dynamic relationships \nfor a type can be understood. We will use the type ENTP as \nan example. \n\nENTP is an Extravert with Intuition (N) as the domi- \nnant, extraverted function and Thinking (T) the auxiliary, \nintroverted function. In theory, therefore, ENTPs trust Intu- \nition (#1) most, use it most, develop it most, and shape \ntheir lives to give the maximum freedom for pursuing their \nintuitive goals. They use their Thinking (22) in pursuit of \nsomething challenging to their Intuition but may not let \ntheir Thinking (#2) veto anything their Intuition (41) seri- \nously desires. Being oriented to the challenge of new possi- \nbilities (N #1) in the outer world (E), they may often find \nthemselves committed to too many projects.

    "content": "underestimate the time it takes to bring activities to com- \npletion. When the ENTP decides there are too many activi- \nties for the available time, the Thinking (#2) function is \nneeded. The ENTP withdraws into the inner world (D, ana- \nlyzes the costs and consequences of continuing or dropping \neach activity, and makes a logical judgment (22) about \nwhich projects to drop. With more mature type develop- \nment, the ENTP may learn to take time to pull back from \nthe exciting challenges (N #1) for action (E) and consider \n(D whether the costs permit adding new activities (T #2) \nbefore taking on new commitments. \n\nThe fourth, or inferior, function of ENTP is Sensing (#4). \nENTPs need to train themselves not to neglect realities (#4) \nin the enthusiasm for possibilities (#1). Type theory says \nthat Sensing (#4) and Feeling (#3) develop more slowly for \nan ENTP One way to develop Sensing and Feeling is on a \nproject chosen by Intuition (#1). To accomplish the project \nthe ENTP will need to know many facts and be able to deal \nwith many practical details; thus Sensing (24) comes into \nplay to help Intuition (41). Further, the project may require \nworking in a team or persuading other people; thus Feeling \n(#3) also comes in to help Intuition (#1). In good type \ndevelopment, people tend to use their less-preferred func- \ntions in the service of their preferred functions, rather than \nout of attraction to the less-familiar functions themselves. \n\nThe preceding description of the way ENTPs use their \ntype dynamics should not be taken literally as a hard-and- \nfast, methodical procedure that all ENTPs follow. Rather, \nthe dynamics of any particular type tend to flow naturally \nand seamlessly from function to function, usually without \nthe conscious attention of the individual. \n\nDynamics of Type Reflected \nin the Type Descriptions \n\nThe descriptions of each of the types are built on the same \nkinds of dynamic principles that were shown in the descrip- \ntion of ENTP The booklets in the Introduction to Type series \nare valuable guides for describing the MBTI types. Notice \nthat in the Introduction to Type booklets, descriptions for \ntypes with the same dominant function appear on facing \npages. It is important to understand that the type descrip- \ntions, which may seem like horoscopes to the uninitiated, \nare firmly based on the dynamics of type theory, supple- \nmented by years of observation of the types and empirical \nresults from research. \n\nTypes Are Created by Exercise of Preferences \n\nUnder this theory, people create their type by the exer- \ncise of their preferences with regard to their use of percep- \ntion and judgment. People who have the samc preferences \ntend to have in common whatever qualities result from the \nexercise of those preferences. The interests, values, needs, \nand habits of mind that naturally result tend to produce a \n\nrecognizable kind of person. We can therefore begin to \npartly describe individuals by stating their preferences as \nENTP. ESFJ, INFP or whatever the case may be. \n\nWe can also begin intelligently to expect ENTPs to be \ndifferent from others in ways characteristic of previously \nknown ENTPs. To describe them as belonging to that type \n(if they agree that it is their type) in no way infringes on \ntheir right to be what they like. They were exercising that \nright when they found, consciously or unconsciously, that \nthey liked Extraversion, Intuition, Thinking, and the Per- \nceiving attitude. \n\nIn dcaling with people, when we keep their type in mind, \nwe are respecting not only their abstract right to develop \nalong lines of their own choosing but also the importance of \nqualities they have developed by making that choice. For exam- \nple, if, for whatever rcason, they have not exercised one or \nmore of their preferences, they may not have developed a \ntype, or at least a type that they can report clearly. Not every- \none is a type. Young people in particular may respond to the \nMBTI tool at a stage when their type is just beginning to \nemerge in a way they themselves can recognize and report. \nOne purpose of administering the MBTI to young people, \nincluding those whose type has not vet fully evolved, is to \nhelp familiarize them with the areas with which they may be \nstruggling. Conscious awareness of the opposite poles of \neach dichotomy may enable them to clarify and gain confi- \ndence with an emerging natural preference. \n\nLearning About the Types \n\nOnce the principles of type dynamics are understood, the \nnext step is to see how these dynamics play out in each of \nthe 16 types. Perhaps the best way to approach this learning \nis to adopt a typological lens when interacting with others \nand observing them in their daily lives. Finding consisten- \ncies in the attitudes and behaviors of people of the same or \nsimilar types that make typological sense\" adds to ones \ndepth of understanding.

In creating the Indicator, Isabel Myers was confi- \ndent of peoples ability to report accurately about them- \nselves. That same confidence in peoples knowledge of \nthemselves can greatly enhance our understanding of the \n16 types. \n\nType theory seems simple, but it is in fact rich and com- \nplex. People of the same type differ in many ways. Some \nwithin-type differences may reflect habitual ways in which \na person expresses aspects of less-preferred functions and \nattitudes, as indicated in the Step II Expanded Interpretive \nReport (EIR). Ones type may also be affected by social and \ncultural pressures and by the stage of type development \n\nreached. To truly understand type, there is no substitute for \na prolonged period of interested skepticism in which you \nmatch your observations and knowledge of people with \npredictions from Jungs theory. \n\nOther strategies for understanding the types are de- \nscribed in the next chapter. \n\nConclusion \n\nThis chapter has placed the MBTI personality inventory in \nthe context of Jungs development of the theory of psycho- \nlogical types, beginning with his attempt to classify people \ninto the two categories of extraverts and introverts, and his \nlater addition of the two pairs of opposite functions (sensing \nversus intuition and thinking versus feeling) to his descrip- \ntive system. Myers and Briggs extended Jungs three-category \nsystem to include a fourth pair ol attitudes, Judging and Per- \nceiving. The J-P dichotomy describes identifiable external \nbehavior, in addition to enabling the determination of type \ndynamics. Definitions, descriptions, and examples of the \nopposite functions and attitudes and their different dynamic \n\nThe Theorv Behind the MBTI 33 \n\ninteractions were given as illustrations of both the complex- \nity and practical applications implicit in using the MBTI. \n\nJungs notion of type development and the goals of \ndevelopment over the life span were explained and illus- \ntrated, the rationale and method for determining the \ndynamics of any four-letter type were set out, and an exam- \nple of how type dynamics emerge in one type was given in \ndetail. \n\nIn summary, the MBTI contains four separate dichoto- \nmies: E-I, S-N, T-E and J-P Two of these, S-N and T-F \ndescribe functions and reflect basic preferences for use of \nperception and judgment. The other two, E-I and J-P \nreflect attitudes or orientations. Together, these functions \nand orientations influence how a person perceives a situa- \ntion and decides on a course of action.{All of these choices \nare like forks in the road of human development, offering \ndifferent paths that lead toward different kinds of excel- \nlence. How far different individuals will go, how much \nexcellence they will actually achieve, depends in part upon \ntheir energy and aspirations. The kind of excellence toward \nwhich they are headed is determined, according to type the- \nory, by the inborn preferences that direct them at each fork \nin the road.'? \n\ni TUL E pe LE M 45 oM vt La dp j^ D al NES T \n\n| la otn oca tlli up cor eres on P Et T aL wert DYN (qe 15r eode. vieta \" \"i \nacc dion og otov nte Jig Gare. a aii edd rc o Va rd.

The usefulness of feedback to any individu- \nals, groups, and organizations may depend to a large extent \nupon the interpreters knowledge of characteristics associ- \nated with each of the 16 types. People who are new to type \ncan find that keeping 16 different personalities in mind is \nrather daunting, as comfortable familiarity with the distine- \ntive qualities of the types requires considerable time and \nexperience. Trying to memorize the characteristics of the 16 \ntypes is not helpful and does not lead to an appreciation of \nthe dynamic character of type. Therefore, this chapter pro- \nvides some approaches to learning about type that will help \nmove practitioners from an initial focus on the four type \ndichotomies to a familiarity with and understanding of the \n\ncomplex wholes represented in the 16 types. \n\n39 \n\n36 Theory \n\nThe goal of this chapter is 10 enhance understanding of \ntype differences for both new and experienced users of the \nMyers-Briggs Type Indicator personality inventory. The basic \ngroundwork for understanding the 16 types was provided \nin Chapter 3, which explained the theoretical basis for the \ndynamic character of the types. This chapter builds on that \nknowledge in the following ways: \n\nB it lacilitates acquisition of knowledge through familiar- \nity with type tables and through precision in the use of \ntype language. \n\nB li provides descriptions of the characteristics of groupings \nof types that have two preferences in common. These \ninclude combinations of the functions, combinations of \nthe attitudes, and attitude-function combinations. \n\nm By focusing first on these building blocks\" of type it is \neasier to understand and retain the qualities associated \nwith dynamic whole types. \n\nW lt describes two-letter type combinations and whole types \ntrom three perspectives: the Jung-Myers theory, careful \nobservation by experienced type experts and the self- \nreports of individuals, and the most current empirical \nresearch. The research eited focuses on evidence relevant \nto the distinctive features of a particular grouping or whole \ntype. The three-pronged approach to type deseriptions \ntheory, observation, researchensures confidence in our \nunderstanding of tvpe similarities and differences in a \nwide variety of circumstances and application settings. \n\nA wealth of descriptive, anecdotal, and research informa- \ntion is available that describes whole types and the various \ncombinations of type preferences. To facilitate learning, this \nchapter will first focus on two-letter type groupings and \nthen concentrate on describing the 16 whole types. \n\nUsing Type Tables to \nPromote Understanding \n\nAn exeellent way to begin to understand whole types and \nparticular combinations of preferences is to become famil- \niar with the type table, which presents the 16 types ina logi- \ncal relationship. There is much to be learned from type \ntables; they show the frequencies of types in groups of peo- \nple that have characteristics in common: for example, the \nsame occupation, college major, avocation, management \nphilosophy, or communication style. A wide variety of vari- \nables of interest to researchers and practitioners can be \nexplored using type tables, allowing easy visual observation \nso that hypotheses can be explored. Statistical analysis of \ntype table data ensures confidence in the meaning inferred \ntrom the type frequeneies observed. A common statistic \nused is the self-selection ratio (SSR), which compares the \npercentage of each type in a sample relative to its percentage \nin an appropriate base comparison group. For a detailed \nexplanation of this statistic, see Chapter 9. \n\nExtraversion-Introversion Sensing-intuition \nThinking-Feeling Judging-Perceiving \n\nFigure 4.1 Format of Type Tables \n\nType theory leads us to hypothesize that the groupings of \ntypes on particular type tables are the result of choices that \nare directly or indirectly influenced by type preferences. For \nexample, if an occupation requires attention to detail, sys- \ntem, and order and if that occupation attracts the types who \nin theory should prefer attention to detail, system, and \norderthe Sensing Judging typesthen the table provides \nconstruct validity for type theory as well as useful infor- \nmation for career counselors. If a type table shows that \nFeeling types are rarely found in a particular high-pressure, \nproduct-focused company, this could help a management \nconsultant explain some possible communication issues \nthat are causing problems for the company. Many of the \napplications chapters in Part V of this manual present infor- \nmation and analyze data in type table form.",

    "content": "Placement of Types on the Type Table \n\nThe type table was designed by fsabel B. Myers as a way to \nhighlight similarities and differences of the types by their \nplacement in the table. Familiarity with the placement of \ntypes enables quick recognition of which types predominate \nand which are infrequent in different samples and popula- \ntions. Figure 4.1 depicts the format of type tables. Note that \neach type has three letters in common with any adjacent \ntype. The placement of each of the preferences and the ratio- \nnale given by Myers for placements are described below. \n\nExtraverts (E) and Introverts (1) Introverted types appear \nin the first and second rows of the type table. Extraverted \ntypes appear in rows 3 and 4. Isabel Myers mnemonie aid \nfor E-1 placement is that Introverts are more likely to have \ntheir heads up in the clouds, and Extraverts are more likely \nto have their feet down on the ground. \n\nSensing (S) Types and Intuitive (N) Types Sensing types \nand Intuitive types are positioned on the type table in the \nsame order as in the name of the S-N dichotomy, namely \nwith Sensing on the left and Intuition on the right. \n\nThinking (T) Types and Feeling (F) Types The Thinking \ntypes compose the two outer columns of the table. Feeling \ntypes are contained in the two inner columns. Myers chose \nthis placement so that it would be easy to remember by \nconsidering that the Feeling types, with their greater need \nfor affiliation, are in the middle columns, surrounded by \nother types. The more objective Thinking types are in the \nouter columns, with unpeopled space beside them. \n\nJudging (J) Types and Perceiving (P) Types Note that the \ndecisive Judging types are found in the top and bottom \nrows, giving boundaries for the flexibility and adaptability \nof the Pereeiving types, who are in the two middle rows. \n\nSummary \n\nType tables and type groupings present data on the con- \nstruct validity of the MBTIthat is, evidence that the \nMBTI accurately reflects Jung's theory and the construets \nit includes. Type tables also provide information and \ninsight into the characteristies of the types. One goal of \nbecoming familiar with the type table format is to be able \nto recognize a samples characteristics at a glance and thus \nobtain a great deal of information quickly. As an aid for \nachieving this goal, Table 4.1, arrayed as a standard type \ntahle, shows the contribution that each preference makes \nto each of the 16 types, regardless of the unique dynamics \nof each type. \n\nIdentifying Groupings \nof the Preferences \n\nWhen practitioners use the same terms to mean different \nthings, confusion and misunderstanding inevitably occur. It \nis therefore important to clarify the terminology used to \nrefer to particular combinations of type preferences in order \nto achieve consistency in the use of language among MBTI] \nusers. This section covers terminology for combinations of \nExtraversion and Introversion with each of the four fune- \ntions (E and I with S, N, T, and F), groupings of the four \nattitudes (E and I with J and P), and combinations of the \nfour mental functious (S and N with T and F). \n\nUnderstanding the 16 Types 37 \n\nIn the past, terms such as Extraverted Intuitive types, or \nEN types, were sometimes used to refer to all types whose \nfour letters included Extraversion and Intuition (ENF], \nENTJ, ENFP, and ENTP) or to refer to the two types for \nwhom extraverted Intuition is the dominant function \n(ENTP, ENFP). The first usage does not take type dynamies \ninto account, while the second meaning of the combination \nrefers to the dynamic character of types. The current empha- \nsis on studying whole types and type dynamics makes elar- \nity in such terminology critical. The terminological conven- \ntions described below are used throughout this manual and \nare included in the Glossary. \n\nCombining Extraversion or \nIntroversion with the Four Functions \n\nOnly two types share the same dominant function and atti- \ntude. For example, ISFP and INFP are referred to as the domi- \nnant introverted Feeling types. However, four types share a pref- \nerence for the same attitude and function. For example, ISFP. \nISFJ, INFP and INF] share a preference for Introversion and \nFeeling; we refer to these four types as having a preference \nfor Introversion with Feeling. \n\nConfusion can oceur when the attitude of Extraversion or \nIntroversion is combined with one of the four functions, \nSensing, Intuition, Thinking, or Feeling. Terms such as dom- \ninant introverted Sensing types and dominant extraverted \nThinking types are used to identify the dynamic combina- \ntions. However, when the four types who prefer both Extra- \nversion and Thinking are presentESTJ, ENTJ, ESTP \nENTPthe designation Extraversion with Thinking is cor- \nrect. The same convention is used with other combinations \nof E and I with the other functions. \n\nCombining the Four Attitudes \n\nCombining E and | with | and P gives us practical insights \nabout type dynamics.",

Sensing Thinking (ST) types, for example, are only the \nfour types that prefer both Sensing and Thinking; Intuitive \nFeeling (NF) types are those four types who prefer both \nIntuition and Feeling. Other two-letter and three-letter \neombinations may also be studied but do not present termi- \nnological difficulties.

Characteristics found in only one \nor two types in a group of four should not be reported as \ntypical of the whole group. This section provides brief \ndescriptions of the characteristics of each group based upon \nour expectations from type theory and consistent findings \nof experienced observers. It is important to bear in mind \nthat these descriptions apply to mature, well-developed \nmembers of each grouping and may not apply to all people \nwho self-report that type. \n\nFollowing each description is a table summarizing \nselected research results relevant to that group of types. The \nresearch summaries are divided into four general content \nareas. Research relevant 10 personality variables, psychother- \napy, health, stress, and coping are shown first because type \ntheory was developed by Jung to address his observations of \nnormal personality differences within the context of his psy- \nchotherapeutic practice. Education research appears next, \nfollowed by research on type and career variables. Education \nwas an early and continuing focus of Isabel Myers in her own \nresearch, as were the implications of type for career choice \nand career satisfaction. The last content area is organizations, \nleadership, management, and teams. This is the most recent \narea to receive research attention. \n\nReaders may note that although a good deal of research \nhas focused on specific type groupings, detailed informa- \ntion for some groupings is much more extensive than for \nothers. The fact that there is little research evidence describ- \ning particular groupings may be due to little interest in the \ngrouping by researchers or the scope and focus of the \n\nresearch, rather than the actual absence of notable charac- \nteristics for that grouping. For groupings where there is \nvery little research to report, a brief narrative describing the \navailable research is provided instead of a table. \n\nThere is little information available for some type groupings \n\nand combinations of preferences, perhaps due to lack of \ninterest on the part of researchers. \n\nThe summaries of research contained in all of the tables \nin this chapter are constrained by the following factors: \n\nm They are dependent on what researchers have chosen to \nstudy and what they decided to report in their research \narticles and therefore may not represent all possible \npotentially useful information. \n\ngm The research reported is limited to compilations of MBTI \nresearch results, rather than individual journal articles. \nFor example, previous research as well as the most \nrecent research that emerged from the national sample \nstudies are included in the application chapters of Part V \nof this manual. Those chapters therefore serve as a \nresearch source. The same is true of the chapters in MBTI \nApplications (Hammer, 1996b), another source for the \nresearch results in this chapter. \n\nw Only statistically significant results and clearly distin- \nguishing rankings on variables are listed. However, sam- \nple sizes and research methods vary considerably. Caution \nin interpretation and generalization of results is there- \nfore appropriate. \n\n40 . Theory \n\nm The results included are limited to those that could be \nbriefly summarized and easily understood without \ndetailed explanations. Studies that look at more complex \ntype issues are therefore not included. \n\nSource notes follow each table. Readers who wish detailed \ninformation about a particular research result should consult \nthe sources cited. Following each table and its source notes \nis a brief commentary that highlights interesting findings \nand contrasts some of the results for that combination or \ntype with results found for other relevant preference combi- \nnations and types. These comments attempt to place the \nrescarch within a broader context of societal expectations \nand biases. Because the comments do not summarize the \nresearch results, it is best to review each table before reading \nthe comments. \n\nAdditional Cautions in \nInterpreting Research Results \n\nInteresting observations emerge when we look at research \nfor particular type groupings and whole types in the four \ncontent areas described above. Most notable is the fact that \npeople with some combinations of two preferences, as well \nas some whole types that are presented later in the chapter, \nseem to be associated with \"positive\" characteristics in one \nor more content areas while other combinations and types \nare characterized in a more \"negative\" way. This is particu- \nlarly evident in results in the first content area personality, \npsychotherapy, health, stress, copingand the second \nareaeducation. These kinds of effects highlight the pres- \nence of the type bias that results when a single norm is \napplied to everyone within our society. In such a single-",

    "content": "norm approach, some types inevitably are viewed as more \ncompetent, emotionally adapted, or successful than are \nother types whose qualities are not in accord with the cul- \ntural notion of the \"desirable\" individual. For example, test \nitems designed to assess qualities such as self-confidence, \noptimism, comfort in the outer world, stress tolerance, and \ngood coping skills are likely to overlap in content with \ncharacteristics that legitimately reflect a preference for \nExtraversion or Introversion. This overlap in item content, \nalong with the effects of living in a society that favors an \nExtraverted over an Introverted use of energy, contributes \nto some of the negative- and positive-seeming research \nresults reported in some tables. Chapter 10 discusses some \nof these issues in more detail. \n\nBias is also evident in the area of education, where there \nseems to be a prevailing assumption that everyone learns in \nthe same ways and therefore should respond well to the \nsame teaching methods. From a typological perspective \nthere are distinct differences in the ways different types \nlearn. This is apparent in how the types perform on stan- \ndard educational achievement measures and in such behav- \nioral measures as school dropout rates. Chapter 11 presents \nthe details of such sources of type bias. \n\nAnother factor should inhibit overgeneralizing and mak- \ning inferences about the brief research results shown in the \ntables. Whereas the descriptions of the typical characteristics \nof members of the type groupings and whole types reflect \nmature, well-developed people, research studies very likely \ninclude a quite broad spectrum of those same types. We can- \nnot tell from the data shown to what extent this factor may \ncontribute to both the more negative characterizations found \nin some tables and the more positive outcomes observed. \n\nThe discussion of each type grouping begins with the \ndistinctive dynamic feature that the types in each group \nshare. The descriptive phrases shown for each grouping \nwere created by Isabel Myers to identify and help people \nremember its central distinctive feature. \n\nThe Columns of the Type Table: The Four \nMental Functions (ST, SE, NE NT) \n\nIsabel Myers considered the columns of the type table to be \nthe most important of the groupings of the types, particularly \nwhere career choices are concerned. These groups focus \non the combinations of perception (S and N) with judgment \n(T and F). The type characteristics are assumed to stem from \nthe preferred use of these mental functions. The pairings of \nfunctions have received a great deal of research attention \nover the years. Function pairings are often viewed as learn- \ning styles or cognitive styles. This is an area of interest to \neducators, career counselors, and organization specialists. \n\nTwo column types, NF and NT, are also used to designate \ntwo of the four temperaments described by Keirsey and Bates \nand discussed later in this chapter (Keirsey &amp; Bates, 1978). \nThe focus in describing NF and NT as temperaments is dif- \nferent from the present focus. However, for ease of contrast, \nthe research results that describe NF and NT types in this \nsection are repeated in the section on temperaments. \n\nTable 4.3 compares the column types based on a knowl- \nedge of their components. Specific descriptive and research \ninformation about each of the four column types follows. \n\nSTs: The Practical and Matter-of-Fact Types \n\nFor the four Sensing Thinking (ST) types, one of the two \nfunctions, Sensing or Thinking, is the dominant function, \nand the other is the auxiliary function. \n\nST people rely primarily on Sensing for purposes of per- \nception and on Thinking for purposes of judgment. Their \nmain interests focus on facts because facts can be collected \n\nUnderstanding the 16 Types 41 \n\nTable 4.3 The Combinations of Perception and Judgment \n\nST \n\nPeople who prefer Sensing and Thinking \n\nFocus attention on Facts Facts \nAnd handle these with \nThey tend to become \n\nNonpersonal analysis \n\nPractical and \n\nmatter-of-fact friendly \n\nTechnical areas with \nfacts and objects \n\nAnd find scope for \ntheir abilities in \n\nSensing and Feeling \nPersonal warmth \nSympathetic and \n\nPractical help and \nservices for people \n\nNF NT \nIntuition and Feeling Intuition and Thinking \n\nPossibilities Possibilities \n\nPersonal warmth Nonpersonal analysis \n\nEnthusiastic and \ninsightful \n\nLogical and \ningenious \n\nUnderstanding and Theoretical and \ncommunication with people technical developments \n\nand verified direcily by the sensesby seeing, hearing, \ntouching, counting, weighing, and measuring.

    "content": "STs will be attracted to fields that demand nonpersonal \nanalysis of concrete facts, such as economics, law, surgery, \nbusiness, accounting, production, and the handling of \nmachines and materials. The frequency with which ST \ntypes are found in such fields bears this out. Table 4.4 sum- \nmarizes relevant research results for ST types. \n\nMost of the results in Table +.4 seem in accord with an ST \napproach to the content areas shown. For example, seeking \npersonal counseling is not a natural way of solving prob- \nlems for types who focus on logically assessing the facts of \ntheir situation. STs academic performance, educational and \ncareer preferences, and characteristics as leaders, managers, \nand team members are also consistent with the qualities that \nwould be expected for people who focus on Sensing and \nThinking as the preferred ways of perceiving and coming to \nconclusions. Possible support for the reported disadvantage \nthat Sensing types face from typical academic testing proce- \ndures is shown in the overrepresentation of ST types in the \nAcademic Decathlon (a performance-based indicator of \ncompetence) relative to their frequency as National Merit \nFinalists (a test score-based\" indicator). \n\nSFs: The Sympathetic and Friendly Types \n\nef B \n\nFor Sensing Feeling (SF) types, one of the two functions, \nSensing or Feeling, is the dominant function, and the other \nis the auxiliary function. \n\nSF people, like ST people, rely primarily on Sensing for \npurposes of perception, but they prefer Feeling for purposes \nof judgment. They too are mainly interested in facts they \ncan gather directly through the senses, but they approach \ntheir decisions with a subjectivity that is based on their per- \nsonal value system. This subjectivity and the warmth they \nconvey comes from their trust of Feeling, with its power to \nweigh how much things matter to themselves and others. \nIn contrast to Sensing Thinking types, they are more inter- \nested in facts about people than in facts about things. \n\nSFs tend to be sympathetic and friendly. In theory, we \nwould expect them to be attracted to fields where their per- \nsonal warmth can be effectively applied to concrete situa- \ntions. The combination of Sensing and Feeling can be valu- \nable in selling tangibles, service-with-a-smile jobs, teaching \n(especially in the early grades and applied fields), nursing, \npediatrics, and other health helds involving direct patient \ncare. The sympathetic and friendly SFs are frequent at all \nlevels of direct patient care. Table +.5 summarizes relevant \nresearch results for SF types. \n\nThere is a growing body of research that shows overrep- \nresentation of some Sensing types among people with \nhypertension and/or heart disease. These findings are pre- \nsented and discussed in Chapter 10. The specific and \nintriguing finding in Table 4.5 with regard to SF males can \nyield many hypotheses that require empirical evidence to \nsupport or negate them as possible explanations for the \nresearch result. For example, one could conjecture that the \nqualities of conscientiousness and loyalty that may con- \ntribute to SF ovcrrepresentation among hypertensives are \nsimilar to those that contribute to SF underreprescntation in \nreferrals to substance abuse programs. For this and similar \nfindings, however, we must consider the amount and kind \nof contribution type may make to the diagnosis of hyper- \ntension, as well as recognizing that the majority of SF males \ndo not suffer from hypertension. \n\nAs was found for the ST group, the education results \nsupport often-noted bias toward Intuition in our educa- \ntional assessment procedures, and both teacher beliefs and \napproaches in organizational settings highlight differences \nbetween the ST qualities shown in Table 4.4 and the SF ori- \nentation reflected in this table. \n\n42 Theory \n\nTable 4.4 Research Describing ST Types \n\nPersonality, Psychotherapy, \nHealth, Stress, Coping \n\n   eee a enn  PRE VR \n\nUnderrepresented among students seeking counseling! \n\nMM c-r  - Mu Kis Tu ^e dpt e P 5 \n\nAs teachers, endorsed an external system of belief about discipline for children (children develop as a \n\nPerformed worse than INF types on a series of academic aptitude tests among middle school students? \n\n2 \n\nOverrepresented among Academic Decathlon participants compared with their proportion among \n\nOverrepresented among female school administrators in the People's Republic of China? \n\nOverrepresented among Hawaiian foreign language students at the University of Hawaii \n\n3 \n\nRanked lowest among chemical engineering students in passing curriculum? \n\nMARRE mX-GURGE ICE NCTUNOACO Wu apMmRmMEm 1w. aM moo uper Cata psal e 72e a Cali 0 auta ed \n\n19 44 \n\nEducation \nresult of external conditions)? \nOutperformed both NF and NT dental hygiene students? \nSecond highest in number of reported books read per year \nNational Merit Finalists? \n\nCareers",

IJs can appear resis- \ntant to change because they extravert their preferred auxil- \niary judging funetion, Thinking or Feeling. This means \nthey state their conclusions rather than providing the data \nfor their conclusions (their introverted, dominant perceiv- \ning function). They can therefore appear to others to be \nadamant and inflexible. However, since their pereeiving \nfunction is the dominant, most crucial one, they will relin- \nquish a conclusion if provided with new information that \ncontradicts the conclusion, even when it scems to other \npeople that the IJs decision is firm and intractable. Table \n3.8 summarizes relevant research results lor YJ types. \n\nOne might cautiously infer that the results showing that \nfemale lJ types report longer and fewer marriages is a reflec- \ntion of a likely IJ emphasis on persistence, stability, and \npermanence in many aspects of life.

This same discrepancy between college behaviors \nand later appearance in substance abuse treatment pro- \ngrams occurs for other type groupings and types, as will be \nscen in later Chapter 4 tables. \n\nResearch results in the areas of cducation, careers, and \norganizational variables all seem in accord with expectations \nconsidering the qualities associated with the IJ combination. \n\nIPs: The Adaptable Introverts \n\nAll four Introverted Perceiving (IP) types have a dominant \nintroverted judging function and an auxiliary extraverted \nperceiving lunction. \n\n[Ps arc introspective, adaptable in little things, and firm on \nimportant issues because their dominant judging function is \ncentral to their personality. Others may assume that the outer \nflexibility and adaptability of IPs reflects their internal state \nas well. Such an assumption is usually unjustified, especially \n\nwhen important inner judgments are at issue. In such cir- \ncumstances, the flexibility of the IPs extraverted auxiliary \npercciving function can be overridden by their dominant \njudging function, Thinking or Feeling. When this occurs, \nIPs can appear intractable and resistant to change. For new \ninformation to be effective in promoting a willingness to \nchange, it must address the logic or values of their dominant \njudging function or it will be rejected as irrelevant. Table 4.9 \nsummarizes relevant research results for IP types. \n\nAt first glance, we might assume that the four IP types \nISTP. ISFP, INTP and INFPmay be vulnerable to some per- \nsonal and relationship difficulties, as well as carcer indecision \nand dissatisfaction, while valuing work autonomy and adapt- \ning well to change in the work setting. However, an under- \nstanding of type provides a context within which to realisti- \ncally assess the probable meaning of some of the results \nshown. The previously mentioned limitations of substance \nabuse data need to be considered here. That ITP females \nreport more marriages may be related to their observed ten- \ndency to be less satisfied with relationships in general, as dis- \ncussed in Chapter 10, where it is suggested that different \ndefinitions of satisfaction may be operating for different types. \n\nThe education, career, and organizational variables that \nseem to distinguish IP types are quite consistent with a \nhighly flexible approach to life. IP types may not be particu- \nlarly motivated to seck the closure of a career decision, nor \nby standard notions of leadership and control of their \nenvironment. Career decisiveness and leadership are highly \nvalued in our culture, and therefore IP types tend to stand \nout as marching to a different drummer. If carefully done",

They adapt even more easily to new outer \nconditions than do the IPs, for whom the extraverted per- \nceiving function has only an auxiliary status. Their domi- \nnant extraverted perceiving function leads them to trust and \neagerly engage the outer world. They are optimistic about \nwhat that outer world has to offer and about their ability to \ninteract with it in a satisfying way. Their optimism may be \nperceived as excessive risk taking to types who approach \nthe world more cautiously (often the types who introvert \ntheir perceiving functionfor example, dominant intro- \nverted Sensing (ISJ) and dominant introverted Intuitive \n(INJ) types). EPs embrace new opportunities with opti- \nmism, and obstacles are seen as merely temporary setbacks \n\nor challenges to be met. At times, the pull to new experi- \nences or possibilities in the world can override their auxil- \niary introverted judgment, and they may in fact fail to \nachieve their optimistic intent. Table 4.10 summarizes rele- \nvant research results for EP types. \n\nIt makes quite a difference when the dominant function \nof a type grouping is an extraverted perceiving function \nrather than an introverted judging oneat least in the \nkinds of variables reflected in Table 4.10 for EP types, as \ncompared with Table 4.9 for IP types. Remember that both \nIP and EP types extravert their perceiving function and \nintrovert their judging function, but for IP the extraverted \nfunction is the auxiliary one, and for EP it is the dominant \nfunction. The EP types appear less frequently in substance \nabuse groups than the IP types, in spite of the fact that col- \nlege officials assess them as showing behaviors that reflect \nor are predictive of substance abuse problems. \n\nIn this table, EP types seem to demonstrate the same \nkind of flexibility and adaptability as the IP types, but their \ndominant extraverted perceiving function may contribute \nto their greater tendency to engage in societally valued lead- \nership behavior. \n\nEJs: The Decisive Extraverts \n\n48 = Theory \n\n \n\nTable 4.10 Research Describing EP Types \n\nPersonality, Psychotherapy, \nHealth, Stress, Coping \n\nUnderrepresented among male substance abusers \n\nUnderrepresented among females in a substance abuse program \n\nOverrepresented among new college students required to attend substance abuse workshop! \n\nUnderrepresented among men who had undergone coronary bypass surgery? \n\nnc -  ree  \n\nEducation \n\nt sec Fa re ii T  \n\nCareers \n\"Managerial control \"4 \n\nmdi  PNE \n\nOrganizations, Leadership, \nManagement,Teams \n\nOne of two groups least positive about using statistical methods as an information source \n\nmegas ied  ie tt eese etm = srt tt tc \n\n \n\nAs medical students, scored second highest of the four on the 16 PF Leadership Scale? \n\n a te pt att P _ \"-  9  \n\nHigher than Ijs on Physical comfort\" as ideal work environment characteristic; lower than EJs on \n\nOOE EE p EEERAEELA. quOMSsUN IDA REEL ACE   -  \n\nEnthusiastically support transitions at work and respond resourcefully to new demands and challenges;",

It can be difficult for \nthem to let go of a decision or conclusion because their \ndominant judging function (Thinking or Feeling) tends to \nbe more persuasive than their auxiliary perceiving function \n(Sensing or Intuition). They are therefore harder to con- \nvince than the IJs, for whom judgment is auxiliary and has \nless authority in the personality. For EJs, new data are less \ncompelling than the consequences (Thinking or Feeling) of \npersisting in a possibly faulty decision. They are therefore \nmore likely to change their minds if a likely negative effect \nof a course of action is pointed out. EJs are seen hy others as \nnatural leaders, and they relish that role, as it permits them \nto exercise their dominant judging function to reach deci- \nsions and get things done. Table 4.11 summarizes the \nresearch results for EJ types. \n\nA number of the research results in Table 4.11 are oppo- \nsite to or quite dilferent from those in Table 4.9 for the \nopposite IP types, particularly in the substance abuse, edu- \ncational leadership, and career decisiveness areas. Note that \nmost of the characteristics associated with EST], ENT], \nESFJ, and ENFJ are consistent with qualities valued in our \nsociety. In these research results this can be seen especially \nin their apparent comfort with administration, managerial \ncontrol, long-range planning, and apparent effectiveness \nduring organizational change. \n\nCombinations of Perception and Orientations \nto the Outer World: SJ, SP NP, and NJ \n\nThe SJ, SP, NP, and NJ grouping of types identifies types \nthat use the same perceiving function in the same attitude \nof Extraversion or Introversion, regardless of whether their \nperceiving function is dominant or auxiliary in their type. \n\nA focus on this grouping allows us to understand the dif- \nferent dynamics involved in introverting Sensing (character- \nistic of the SJ types) as compared with extraverting Sensing \n(characteristic of the SP types); and extraverting Intuition \n(characteristic of the NP types) as compared with introvert- \ning Intuition (characteristic of the NJ types). A description \nof the distinctive character of these dynamic processes is \nincluded in each of the four sections that describe common \ndynamic elements. These descriptions are adapted from \nIntroduction to Type Dynamics and Development (Myers &amp; \nKirby, 1994). \n\nIt should be noted that two of the combinations in- \ncluded here, SJ and SP, are also used to describe two of the \nfour temperaments identified by Keirsey and Bates, along \nwith the NF and NT combinations previously discussed. As \nwas the case for S] and SP, the research evidence for these \ncombinations that is shown in this section is repeated in the \ndiscussion of the tempcraments. \n\nSJs: The Realistic Decision Makers \n\nAll four Sensing Judging (SJ) types introvert their Sensing \nfunction, regardless of whether it is dominant (IST], ISFJ) or \nauxiliary (ESTJ, ESF]), and extravert their preferred judging \nfunction, Thinking or Feeling.

The \nfocus is on taking in new information and integrating it into \nan internal storehouse for retrieval when needed. When \nintroverting Sensing, ones goal is to form a solid, substantial, \nand accurate understanding of ihe world and ones place in it. \n\nThe effect of introverting Sensing can be seen in the \nways that SJ types are typically described. They are seen as \nseeking order in their environment, as organized, depend- \nable, and conservative. They tend to solve problems by \nreliance on past experiences, and they dislike ambiguity. \nPeople are often unaware of the wealth of factual and expe- \nriential data SJs bring to bear in making decisions because \ntheir data tend to remain inside their heads. When they are \ncalled upon to give evidence and provide the detailed bases \nfor their decisions, other types may feel overwhelmed by \nthe information and see it as unnecessary minutiae. At \ntimes, SJs, especially those for whom introverted Sensing is \ndominant (ISTJ and ISFJ), can run the risk of being dis- \ntracted from their goals by their focus on collecting the facts \nthat are relevant to the goal at haud. Tahle 4.12 summarizes \nrelevant research results for SJ types. \n\nAs was pointed out for substanee abuse data, there are \nlimitations on generalizing hypertension and heart disease \ndata that were collected primarily on samples that appeared \n\nin treatment programs, although evidence from the Con- \nsulting Psychologists Press national sample gives some cre- \ndence to these treatment program results. The responsi- \nble SJ types are not likely to show behaviors that college \nofficials associate with actual or potential substance abuse. \nThe education results in this table pinpoint the tendency of \nmany types who include a preference for Sensing to excel \nin performance-based assessments of competence as com- \npared with test-based measures.

The process \nof introverting Intuition involves attending to unconscious \nimages and connections to develop new patterns and ways of \nseeing things. Ones focus is on changing and reshaping the \nenvironment to bring into being one's inner vision and \ninsight through finding patterns and meaning in the world. \nWhen introverting Intuition, ones goal is to develop inner \nintuitive patterns for understanding the world. \n\nThe process of introverting Intuition is reflected in the \nway NJ types are typically described. They strive to accom- \nplish the goals of their inner vision and are driving, persis- \ntent, and determined. They can be charismatic leaders who \nattract dedicated followers. They have the ability to present \ntheir inner vision in a compelling, convincing way by fram- \ning it in terms of either long-range logical conscquences or \nlong-range impact on important values. \n\nAs is apparent from Table 4.15, NJ types seem to be one \nof the combinations that research and/or researchers find of \nlittle interest, as compared to the other three combinations \nin this grouping. The reported under- and overrepresenta- \ntions among hypertensive patients and Type A behavior are \nsimilar to those observed for NT types (Table 4.7) and arc \nas difficult to interpret without further study. \n\nCombinations of Judgment and Orientations \nto the Outer World: TJ, TP, FP, and FJ \n\nThe grouping of types TJ, TP, FP. and FJ identifies types that \nuse the same judging function in the same attitude of Extra- \nversion or Introversion, regardless of whether their judging \nfunction ts dominant or auxiliary in their type. A focus on \nthis grouping allows us to understand the different dynam- \nics involved in the processes of extraverting Thinking (char- \nacteristic of TJ types) as compared with introverting Think- \ning (characteristic of TP types) and introverting Feeling \n(characteristic of FP types) as compared with extraverting \nFeeling (characteristic of FJ types). A discussion of these \nimportant differences is included in each ol the four scc- \ntions that describe common dynamic elements. \n\nA notable feature of this grouping is the fact that a table \nof research results is provided only for the first combina- \ntion, the TJ types. No table of research results describing \nTPs, FPs, or FJs is included because very few reports of \nrescarch were found within the constraints for inclusion of \nresults. The few results available are therefore provided in \nnarrative form only. The fact that research results are \nreported primarily for the T] combination in this grouping \nmay reflect the unique qualities that permit them to be \ndescribed as executive types, a status that is generally \nhighly valued in our culture. In contrast, the TPs, FPs, and \nFJs hold no similar consistently valued position. \n\nTJs: The Logical Decision Makers \n\nAll four Thinking Judging types extravert Thinking, rc- \ngardless of whether it is the dominant (ESTJ, ENTJ) or \nauxiliary (ISTJ, INTJ) function, and introvert their preferred \nperceiving function, Sensing or Intuition.

Ones focus is on critiquing systems, procedures, and \nideas so that consequences can be anticipated and acted \nupon quickly. When extraverting Thinking, ones goal is to \ncreate logical order in the external world by making the \nouter environment rational. \n\nThe process of extraverting Thinking is apparent in the \nway TJ types are described.

They generally \nuse categorical statements that represent logical conclu- \nsions and avoid modifying terms such as may, tends to, or \ngcnerally. Table 4.16 summarizes relevant research results \nfor TJ types. \n\nAs noted earlier, ihe TJ combination is the only one of \nthis grouping for which research results are available. The \nresearch shown in Table 4.16 is mostly consistent with \nwhat we would expect for people who extravert Thinking, \nfor example, in their preference for cognitive rather than \naffective approaches in psychotherapy. The same results \nregarding hypertension and Type A behavior that were \nfound for NJ and NT types are reported here. Observations \nin the areas of education, careers, and organizations present \nno surprises in this table. \n\nTPs: The Adaptable Thinkers \n\nAll four Thinking Perceiving types introvert Thinking, \nregardless of whether it is their dominant (ISTP, INTP) or \nauxiliary (ESTP, ENTP) function, and extravert their \npreferred perceiving function, Sensing or Intuition. The \nprocess of introverting Thinking involves seeking to order \nones internal thoughts through developing a logical system \nfor understanding. Ones focus is on using reflective \nobservation to critique reality and identify the inconsistencies \nand irrelevancies often overlooked by others. When \nintroverting Thinking, ones goal is to create logical order by \ndeveloping rational principles for understanding the world. \n\nThe process of introverting Thinking ean be observed in \nthe way TP types are deseribed. They are objective, skeptical, \nobservant, and enrious, especially about materials, events, or \npossibilities that have or can be made to fit into consistent and \norderly frameworks. They can be effective trouble-shooters \nwith the ability to hone in on the essence of problems and \nfind logical solutions for them. They are able to consider a \nbroad range of facts, details, or ideas in order to come to the \nmost accurate conclusion and are unlikely to rule anything \nout arbitrarily, regardless of how unorthodox or unlikely it \nmay seem to others.

The \nprocess of introverting Feeling involves seeking an intense, \nmeaningful, and complex inner life through being attuned to \npossible contradictions between ones inner values and ones \nouter life. The focus is on clarifying and maintaining the \nconsistency of ones own valucs and actions, although their \nintensity may seldom be expressed to others. When intro- \nverting Feeling, one goal is io identify an inner core of values \nand establish an external life that is congruent with them. \n\nThe process of introverting Feeling is evident in the way \nFP types are described. They are adaptable, affiliative har- \nmony seekers who are concerned with the human aspects \nof problems. They often have a knack for enlisting support \nfrom others, communicating a sincerity that promotes lik- \ning and trust. They welcome others' ideas and genuinely \nappreciate the contributions people make. Because their \nFeeling function is introverted, however, others may not be \naware of the central values that motivate FPs until one of \nthose values is attacked or disregarded. At such times, the \ntypical flexibility and acceptance of an FP can change to \nstubborn insistence on doing things the right way. \n\nRelevant research for FP types indicates that they were \nunderrepresented among those having Type A behavior \n(Shelton, 1996). Possible contributing factors are difficult \nto explore in the absence of additional information. \n\nFs: The Benevolent Administrators \n\nAll four Feeling Judging (FJ) types extravert Feeling, \nregardless of whether it is the dominant or auxiliary \nfunction in their type. The process of extraverting Feeling \ninvolves secking smooth and harmonious relationships \nwith everyone in ones environment through being highly \nattuned to people's desires and expectations. The focus is \non organizing and structuring the environment to meet \npeople's needs and to facilitate the achievement of \nindividual and group goals. When extraverting Feeling, \none's goal is to create harmony and cooperation in the \nexternal environment and to facilitate others in getting \nwhat they need and want. The process of extraverting \nFeeling is often misjudged as excessive emotionality. \nWhen a person is extraverting Feeling, important values \nare expressed with the goal of ensuring that those values \nbecome actualized in the world. Strong affect often ac- \ncompanies this expression but is secondary to the actu- \nalization of personal values. \n\nThe process of extraverting Feeling can be seen in the \nway FJs are described. They are observant about people and \ntheir needs and are often expressive leaders. They expend \nenergy trying to make people happy and bringing harmony \ninto relationships. They may be erroneously judged as \noverly accommodating and even codependent, since their \nextraversion of Feeling involves bringing harmony into the \nouter world. In fact, at times they may risk overcommit- \nment to others welfare, which may prove stressful when \nthey attempt to honor and fulfill all important obligations. \nFJs are generally quite loyal to others who share important \nvalues and goals and may judge those who deviate from \nthose personal values in negative, sometimes harsh ways. \nIncluding others and being included is an important value \nthat, when not met, may lead the FJ to experience a sense of \nfailure and hurt feelings. \n\nAvailable research indicates that FJs were overrepre- \nsented among Filipino students in a study comparing lan- \nguage students at the University of Hawaii (Kirby &amp; \nBarger, 1996) and were also frequently found in the clergy \n(Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985). This latter result has been \nfound in numerous studies. \n\nCombinations of Orientation of Energy \nand Perception: IS, ES, IN, EN \n\nThe grouping of IN, EN, IS, and ES is referred to as the \nquadrants because these types make up the four quadrants \nof the type table. The quadrants combine the functions of \npereeption (Sensing and Intuition) with the Extraverted or \nIntroverted attitude. Note that the types in these quadrants \nare appropriately deseribed as having Extraversion or Intro- \nversion with Sensing or Intuition. For example, the four \ntypes in the IN quadrant are deseribed as having Introver- \nsion with Intuition beeause the grouping does not refer toa \ndynamic commonality, beyond the fact that Intuition is \neither the dominant or the auxiliary function for these four \ntypes. The same style of designation is used for the other \nthree quadrants. \n\nTable 4.17 Research Describing IS Types",

They like to deal with what is \nreal and factual in a careful, unhurried way and can become \nfrustrated and irritable when they feel rushed and unable to \ndevote adequate attention to the task at hand. They do not \nput themselves forward and prefer to stay in the \nbackground of projects and activities. Their efforts and \naccomplishments can easily be overlooked or taken for \ngranted by others. Regardless of whether their Sensing is \ndominant and introverted (ISTJ, ISFJ) or auxiliary and \nextraverted (ISTP, ISFP), they are likely to aveid leadership \nroles and may experience considerable discomfort when \nforced into such roles. The stress of leading may come to \novershadow and diminish their satisfaction with other, \nenjoyable aspects of their environment. Their quict and \npersistent workstyle and dislike of leadership demands may \nfurther draw attention away from their quiet but often \nsignificant contributions at home and at work. Table 4.17 \nsummarizes relevant research results for IS types. \n\nIt seems likely that the kinds ol situations that appear to \nbe quite stressful for the four IS types contribute to the \nresults seen in Table 4.17 that show overrepresentations in \nthe areas of substance abuse, as cardiac and hypertensive \npatients, and in being diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder. Bear in mind, however, that the results listed may \n\nSee Chapter 10, Uses of Type in Counseling and Psychotherapy, *DiTibeno, 1996, \n\nbe limited by the samples available for study. It is particu- \nlarly noteworthy, therefore, that previously found associa- \ntions between being an IS type and overrepresentation in \ncardiac and hypertensive groups were confirmed in the \nnational sample study, whose subjects were not selected for \nany particular disorder. The implications of this finding are \ndiscussed in Chapter 10. \n\nAs in previous tables, it is interesting that the IS types are \nless frequently referred as substance abuse risks in college but \nbased on these data appear more frequenily in substance \nabuse groups. We might conjecture that college officials are \nattending to the wrong signs and behaviors in their \nattempts to identify at-risk students. It is also possible that IS \ntypes are truly not at risk while in school but that the later \nstresses ol adult life and the workplace promote this and \nother stress-stimulated conditions. The fast-paced, frequently \nchanging, and multiple external demands of todays work \nenvironment do not necessarily permit IS types to function in \ntheir most comfortable ways. Future research may better pin- \npoint the complex and likely interacting variables involved. \n\nAs four types who are most comfortable when keeping \nto the background of their environments, it is not surpris- \ning that there are few reports of notable characteristics in \nthe areas of education, careers, and organizations. \n\nINs: The Thoughtful Innovators \n\n56 Theory \n\nTable 4.18 Research Describing IN Types \n\nPersonality, Psychotherapy, \nHealth, Stress, Coping \n\nOverrepresented among students preferring cognitive approaches to psychotherapy; \nunderrepresented for affective approaches! \n\nUnderrepresented among behavioral psychologists, except for INTPs! \n\nMore likely to be substance abusers \nMore likely to be overrepresented among female substance abusers \nUnderrepresented among members of a cardiac rehabilitation program \nnicucpis nen among male hypertensive uos \n\nn a ra he n tee eT e qe T Tem m Pe PIS \n\n p   \n\nEducation \nundergraduates? \n\nAmong middle school students, performed better than ES types on a series of academic aptitude tests \n\nl \n\n| \n\n2 \n2 \n\nST ET Ah HER Pg a 7 III cr Boer DIRE a EEERUED Dot \n\nObtained higher grades in courses that were abstract and theoretical in a study of 2,713 \n\n3 \n\nAmong student dental hygienists, performed worse than ES or IS students? \n\nObtained higher geometry achievement scores among rural high school students? \n\nOverrepresented among academically gifted junior high students?",

The depth of feeling about individual \nvalues can make them appear overly serious and ex- \nccssively sensitive to their own and others' emotional state. \nUnlike the EFs, who strive to correct disharmony when \nthey find it, IFs are likely to withdraw from such situations \nrather than deal directly with the distressing feelings that \nexist in the situation. \nNo relevant research was found for IF types. \n\nITs: The Reflective Reasoners \n\nIntroverts with Thinking (TIs) are quiet and contemplative. \nThey have concern for basic principles that explain the \ncauses and consequences of events or the workings of things. \nITs are the most removed from daily social intercourse and \nare the slowest to develop social skills. They tend to be \nindifferent to or dislike small-talk and may find many social \ninteractions unwelcome and stressful. They can be seen as \nsocially awkward or may come across as overly formal and \neven unfriendly. Regardless of whether their Thinking is \nintroverted and dominant (ISTP, INTP) or auxiliary and \nextraverted (ISTJ, INTJ), these types are natural and en- \nthusiastic critics of whatever is being presented. The intro- \nverted approach they take while evaluating and critiquing \ncontributes to their shared tendency to maintain an im- \npassive facial expression and body language that seems to \nconvey disapproval or disregard of others. As a result, they \nmay be seen, often erroneously, as overly critical, disdainful, \nor, at best, uninterested in what is going on. \n\nIn research, ITs were found to be overrepresented among \nmales diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (Shel- \nton, 1996). \n\nCombinations That Describe \nthe Four Temperaments: SJ, SP NF, NT \n\nTwo of the combinations of the functions and two of the \ncombinations of perception and orientation to the outer \nworld are used by temperament theorists and researchers to \nidentify the four temperamentssanguine, choleric, phleg- \nmatic, and melancholicoriginally proposed as a descriptive \nsystem by the Greek philosopher Hippocrates (460-377 \np.c.). These were developed and described in modern form \nby David Keirsey and Marilyn Bates (1978) and further \nextended and refined by Linda Berens. The temperaments are \nidentified as Guardian, Artisan, Idealist, and Rationalist. \nKeirsey and Bates found that selectively combining Intuition \n\nUnderstanding the 16 Types 59 \n\nwith the two judging functions (NF and NT) and Sensing \nwith Myers two orientations to the outer world (SJ and SP) \nproduced a descriptive personality system similar to the four \ntemperaments Hippocrates described centuries earlier. Mod- \nern temperament theorists, therefore, use selected type con- \nstructs that are identified by answering the MBTI in order to \napproximate the constructs specified by temperament theory, \n\nIt is important to recognize that temperament theory is not a \nvariant of type theory, nor is type theory a variant of tem- \nperament theory. \n\nType theory and temperament theory are two separate sys- \ntems for explaining personality that are independent of each \nother in origin, in the number and kind of basic elements \neach hypothesizes, and in the way each theorys elements are \ncombined. For example, temperament theory does not \nrequire the E-I dichotomy for its explanatory system and \ndoes not postulate the dynamic hierarchy and interaction of \nfunctions that form the essence of type theory. Temperament \ntheory proposes that four qualitatively different broad cate- \ngories describe major, fundamental aspects of personality. \nHowever, temperament theorists recognize finer distinctions \nthan the four broad categories and ultimately refer to [6 pat- \nterns. Type theory proposes 16 categories for completeness, \nwith many more commonalities among the types than are \nproposed in temperament theory. Both type and tempera- \nment theory share a common goal of identifying, describing, \nand appreciating individual differences in personality that \nemerge from a set of theoretical constructs. \n\nA number of people who were initially interested in the \ntemperament approach have become familiar with type the- \nory because of the use of selected type constructs to describe \nthe temperaments. Their understanding of the temperaments \nhas been enhanced by knowledge of the 16 types and their \ndynamic characteristics. Some people who began with type \ntheory have become familiar with temperament theory \nbecause of the apparent similarity in constructs.

They \n\nmasterfully get the right thirigs in the right place at the right \ntime in the right quantity to the right people and not to the \nwrong people. Guardians know how things have always been \ndone, so they anticipate where things can go wrong.

Competence and responsibility are extremely \nimportant to ISTJs, who expect others to be as dutiful and \ntrustworthy as they require themselves to be. \n\nCharacteristics of ISTJs 1STJs have a profound respect for \nfacts. They use their Sensing primarily internally, where \nthey have a storehouse of information upon which they \ndraw to understand the present. Thus, they are likely to be \n\nB Practical, sensible, and realistic \nB Systematic \n\nISTJs use Thinking in decision making, taking an objec- \ntive, logical, and tough-minded approach. Their focus is on \nthe task or system as a whole, rather than on individuals. \nThus, ISTJs tend to be \n\nB Logical and analytical \nB Detached and reasonable \n\nISTJs are clear and steadfast in their opinions because \nthey have arrived at them by carefully and thoroughly \napplving logical criteria based on their experience and \nknowledge. They believe standard procedures exist because \nsuch procedures work. ISTJs will support change only when \nfacts demonstrate such change will bring better results. \n\nHow Others May See Them IST]Js are sociable when \ncomfortable in the roles they are playing: however, they \ngenerally do not share their wealth of rich Sensing \nobservations and memories except with close friends. \nOthers see their standards and judgments, their desire for \n\nUnderstanding the 16 Types 65 \n\nstructure and schedules, but they may not see their indi- \nvidual, sometimes humorous, private reactions. \n\nIt can be hard for ISTJs to see the sense in needs that dif- \nfer widely from their own; but, once they are convinced \nthat something matters to a person they care about, that \nneed becomes a fact. They then go to great lengths to meet \nthe need, even while continuing to think it doesn't make \nsense. Others usually see ISTJs as \n\nB Calm, reserved, and serious \nB Consistent and orderly \n@ Valuing traditions \n\nPotential Areas for Growth Sometimes life circumstances \nhave not supported ISTJs in the development and ex- \npression of their Thinking and Sensing preferences. \n\nB Ifthey have not developed their Thinking, IST)s may not \nhave reliable ways of dealing with the world and instead \nmay focus solely on their memories and internal data. \n\nm If they have not developed their Sensing, they may rush \ninto premature judgments and actions without consider- \ning new information. \n\nIf ISTJs do not find a place where they can use their gilts \nand be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel \nfrustrated and may \n\nB Become rigid about time, schedules, and procedures \ngo by the book \n\nB Be critical and judgmental of others \n\nB Find it difficult to delegateto trust anyone else to do \nthe job right \n\nIt is natural for ISTJs to give less attention to their non-",

They live in the moment and find enjoyment in \npeople, food, clothes, animals, the natural world, and \nactivities. They seldom let rules interfere with their lives, \nfocusing on meeting human needs in creative ways. \n\nESFPs are excellent team players, oriented to getting the \ntask done with a maximum amount of fun and a minimum \namount of fuss. \n\nCharacteristics of ESFPs ESFPs are interested in people \nand new experiences. Because they learn more from doing \nthan from studying or reading, they tend to plunge into \nthings, learning as they go. They appreciate their possessions \nand take pleasure in them. ESFPs are likely to be \n\nB Observant \nB Practical, realistic, and specific \nB Active, involved in immediate experiences \n\nESFPs make decisions by using their personal values. \nThey use their Feeling judgment internally to make deci- \nsions by identifying and empathizing with others. They are \ngood at interpersonal interactions and often play the role of \npeacemaker. Thus, ESFPs are likely to be \n\nB Generous, optimistic, and persuasive \nm Warm, sympathetic, and tactful \n\nESFPs are keen observers of human behavior. They seem \nto sense what is happening with other people and respond \nquickly to their practical needs. They are especially good at \nmobilizing people to deal with crises. \n\nHow Others May See Them ESFPs get a lot of fun out \nof life and are fun to be with; their exuberance and en- \nthusiasm draw others to them. They are flexible, adapt- \nable, congenial, and easygoing. They seldom plan ahead, \ntrusting their ability to respond in the moment and deal \neffectively with whatever presents itself. They hate struc- \nture and routine and will generally find ways to get around \nthem. \n\nESFPs tend to learn by doing, by interacting with their \nenvironment. They dislike theory and written explanations. \nTraditional schools can be difficult for ESFPs, though they \ndo well when they see the relevance and are allowed to \ninteract with people or the topics being studied. Others \nusually see ESFPs as \n\nW Resourceful and supportive \nB Gregarious, fun-loving, playful, spontaneous \n\nPotential Areas for Growth Sometimes life circumstances \nhave not supported ESFPs in the development and ex- \npression of their Feeling and Sensing preferences. \n\nm [f they have not developed their Feeling, ESFPs may get \ncaught up in the interactions of the moment, with no \nmechanism for weighing, evaluating, or anchoring \nthemselves. \n\nB If they have not developed their Sensing, they may focus \non the sensory data available in the moment. Their deci- \nsions may then be limited to gratification of their sensual \ndesires, particularly those involving interactions with \nother people. \n\nIf ESFPs do not find a place where they can use their \ngifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usu- \nally feel frustrated and may \n\nm Become distracted and overly impulsive \nB Have trouble accepting and meeting deadlines \nB Overpersonalize others actions and decisions \n\nIt is natural for ESFPs to give less attention to their non-",

If they neglect these \ntoo much, however, they may \n\nB Fail to look at long-term consequences, acting on imme- \ndiate needs of themselves and others \n\nB Avoid complex or ambiguous situations and people \n\nB Put enjoyment ahead of obligations \n\nUnder great stress, ESFPs may feel overwhelmed inter- \nnally by negative possibilities. They then put energy into \ndeveloping simplistic global explanations for their negative \npictures. \n\nTable 4.29 summarizes relevant research for ESFPs. \nMany of the results found for ESTPs apply to ESFPs as \nwell, as do the comments that address the results. However, \nthere are also some interesting differences that may be due \nto the auxiliary introverted Feeling function of ESFPs in \ncontrast to the auxiliary introverted Thinking function of \nthe ESTPs. Gender effects may also be inferred, given the \ndifference in Thinking and Feeling preference incidences \nfor males and females. Thus it is interesting that male \nESFPs are among the three highest types on one measure of \npsychological adjustment (Efficacy) and female ESFPs are \namong the three lowest, while both male and female ESTPs \nare judged to be low on these adjustment measures. Since \nthe Efficacy measure was based on ratings by observers \nwho were naive about type theory and the types of their \nsubjects, this result reflects the way in which these type- \ngender combinations are perceived in our society.

Their \nglobal thinking leads them to develop visionary goals and a \nbroad-brush plan for achieving these within large \norganizational structures. \n\nINTJs value knowledge and expect competence of them- \nselves and others. They especially abhor confusion, mess, \nand inefficieney. | \n\nCharacteristics of INTJS INTJs see things from a global \nperspective and quickly relate new information to overall \n\npatterns. They trust their insightful connections regardless \nof established authority or popular opinions. Dull routine \nsmothers their creativity. INTJs use their Intuition primarily \ninternally, where they develop complex structures and \npictures of the future. They are likely to be \n\ng insightful, creative synthesizers \nm Conceptual, long-range thinkers \n\nINTJs use their Thinking to make logical decisions.

They \nusually don't directly express their most valued and \nvaluable part: their creative insights. Instead, they translate \nthem into logical decisions, opinions, and plans, which they \noften express clearly. Because of this, others sometimes \nexperience INTJs as intractable, much to the surprise of the \nINTJ, who is very willing to change an opinion when new \nevidence emerges.

Dominant introverted Intuitive types with extra- \nverted Thinking are mostly quite different from the other \ndominant Introverted perceiving type with Thinking, the \nISTJs. Except for a reported overrepresentation among sub- \nstance abusers, INTJs are underrepresented among cardiac \nand hypertensive groups, report low stress in two arcas, \nand are low in the negative affectivity measure (described in \nChapter 10).

Although INTJs fulfill many of the positive \nexpectations and values of society, there are some ways in \nwhich their qualities may be viewed less positively. They \nranked lowest in values around home and family and other \nrelationship-centered areas, and though high on the CPI \nscales Responsibility and Self-Control, both kinds of \nachievement measures, and Intellectual Efficiency, they \nwere lower on scales that concern relating to people \nDominance, Sociability, Social Presence, Self-Acceptance, \nGood Impression, and Empathy.

The difference in auxiliary extraverted Feeling \nrather than auxiliary extraverted Thinking yields quite \nstriking contrasts in the personality, stresses, values, inter- \nests, and career- and job-related variables of INF]s. They are \nattracted both to the practice of psychotherapy and to bene- \nfiting from it as clients. In contrast to the INTJs, they report \nthe highest stress of all the types in areas associated with \nwork, intimate relationships, and school and in arcas desig- \nnated as other and report the greatest dissatisfaction with \ntheir marriage/intimate relationship. \n\nINFJs are similar to INTJs in being particularly favored \nin the educational sphere, although their leisure activities \nfocus on introverted activities that are more artistic, in con- \ntrast to the INTJs more intellectual pursuits. \n\nSome insight into the patterns revealed in the personal- \nity area may be gained by reviewing the research results on \ncareers and the work setting. From the values and interests \nshown, as well as from their typological character as highly \nin tune with unconscious communications, one might infer \nthat INFJs are quite sensitive to nuances and undercurrents \nol feeling in many aspects of their lives. As such, situations \nthat are not particularly stressful for some other types may \nprove stressful for INFJs. Their dissatisfactions in many \nareas may be partly due to their possibly idealistic criteria \nfor satisfaction. INFJ males are among the most oblivious to \ntheir partners dissatisfaction in an intimate relationship, \nand INFJs in general express dissatisfaction with their inti- \nmate relationships. \n\nENTP: Extraverted Intuition \nwith Introverted Thinking \n\nDominant function: Nr \nAuxiliary function: T, \nTertiary function: Fi \n\nFourth/inlerior function: S; \n\nUnderstanding the 16 Types TI \n\nAt Their Best People with ENTP preferences constantly \nscan the environment for opportunities and possibilities. \nThey see patterns and connections not obvious to others \nand at times seem able to see into the future.

These are just a few of the results that illus- \ntrate the way in which predictable attitudes and behaviors \ndevelop through the exercise of type preferences. \n\nAlso consistent with an ENTP approach to life is their \nreported standing on variables related to experiencing and \ncoping with stress. They have the highest mean level of \ncoping resources and are highest in coping with stress by \nconfronting the problem,\" report the lowest stress in sev- \neral life areas, are lowest in reporting heart disease and \nhypertension, and are low in job burnout measures. These \nresults are consistent with observations suggesting that \nENTPs and their companion dominant extraverted Intu- \nitive type, the ENFPs, seem to seek out and function effec- \ntively at high levels of siressat least from thc point of view \nof other types. This suggests that the perception of stress \nvaries markedly across the types. Further discussion of \nstress variables appears in Chapter 10. \n\nOne intriguing result shown in fable 4.32 is the exactly \nopposite standing of ENTPs (dominant extraverted Intuitive \ntypes with auxiliary introverted Thinking) and INTJs (domi- \nnant introverted Intuitive types with auxiliary Extraverted \nThinking) on fear of reinjury among chronic pain patients. \nINTJs reported the highest fear and ENTPs the lowest. \nOne might speculate about the possible differential role of \nthe inferior function of these types on this very specific \nbehavior. \n\nResults in the education, career, and organization arcas \nfurther confirm the descriptive characteristics of ENTPs. \nTheir high assertiveness (reported in the personality con- \ntent area) is readily connected to their independence and \ninitiating results on Leadership scales.

The resulting explosive \nanger or hurt tearfulness is quite unnerving to others and \nembarrassing to the usually calm and controlled ISTP \n\nTable 4.34 summarizes relevant research results for \nISTPs. The research summarized in Table 4.34 for ISTPs with \nregard to stress-related variables bears some obvious similari- \nties to the results shown in Table 4.26 for ISTJs. Bear in mind \nthat ISTP dynamics are dominant introverted Thinking with \nauxiliary extraverted Sensing, while dynamics for IST] are \ndominant introverted Sensing with auxiliary extraverted \nThinking. Thus, although these two tvpes share all but one \nletter, their dominant and auxiliary functions and the atti- \ntudes in which they are habitually used are different. l1 seems \nthat sharing the three letters creates many similarities in the \nstress area, while in many other respects the different dynam- \nics of these two types lead to quite different research results \nin other areas, for example in personality descriptors, aca- \ndemic interests, and career and organization variables. \n\nIt is equally interesting to compare the ISTP picture with \nthat presented in Table 4.28 for ESTPs. ISTPs and ESTPs \nuse their preferred functions in the same attitudesthat is, \nboth extravert Sensing and introvert Thinking, but the ISTP \nhas dominant introverted Thinking and auxiliary extra- \nverted Sensing, while the ESTP has dominant extraverted \nSensing and auxiliary introverted Thinking. The effects ol \ntheir different dynamics are quite dramatic in the stress and \ncoping areas and in other ways as well. \n\nAlthough it appears that the commonality of letters to \nIST] types rather than type dynamics is operating regarding \nstress variables, it is also plausible that the underlying rea- \nsons for these similar stress responses may be quite differ- \nent for these two types. The same attitude or behavior is \noften stimulated and motivated by quite different issues for \ndifferent types, and the same issues may be expressed quite \ndifferently in the attitudes and behaviors of different types. \nThese observations apply to type similarities and differ- \nences in general. \n\nISTPs are reported to be overrepresented in substance \nabuse, heart disease, and hypertension groups, post-traumatic \nstress disorder patients, and risk for setbacks due to over- \ndoing among long-term pain patients. They rank low in \nassertiveness, low in mean level of coping resources, lowest \nin using social coping resources, and highest in coping with \nstress by expressing anger and upset, although they were \nlowest in stress associated with balancing home and work. \nThey also ranked lowest in positive allectivity and appeared \nin the four most dissatisfied groups with regard to marriage \nand intimate relationships. What could account for these \n\"negative \"-seeming results? \n\nPerhaps of all the types, ISTPs may be the most specific in \nwhat they find acceptable and appealing and what makes no \n\"logical\" sense to them. Their particular dynamics may thus \nbe associated with resistance to accepting and appreciating \npoints of view divergent from their own.

In fact, expe- \nrience verifies that ISTPs share their most private and inti- \nmate thoughts and feelings with a very few, select people. \nThis selectivity likely contributes to the difficulty other \ntypes have in understanding, appreciating, and getting \nclose to the essence of the ISTP nature. \n\nINTP: Introverted Thinking \nwith Extraverted Intuition \n\nDominant function: T} \nAuxiliary function: Ng \nTertiary function: Sg \n\nFourth/inferior function: Fr \n\nAt Their Best People with INTP preferences are inde- \npendent problem solvers who excel at providing a detached, \nconcise analysis of an idea or situation.

Though they typically work best alone, their \nincisive critiques and summaries can assist a group in get- \nting to the core of complex problems. \n\nCharacteristics of INTPs INTPs use their Thinking \nprimarily internally to find or develop underlying principles \nand logical structures for understanding and explaining the \n\nUnderstanding the 16 Types 85 \n\nworld.

They \nprefer not to organize people or situations. \n\nINTPs are tolerant of a wide range of behavior, arguing \nand raising issues only when they believe it is reasonable to \ndo so. This flexibility disappears, however, when their rul- \ning principles are challenged; then they stop adapting. \nINTPs prize precision in communication and dislike redun- \ndancy or stating the obvious.

Otherwise, they prefer \nproven procedures and systems. Their orientation is to \ntasks, action, and the bottom line. \n\nHow Others May See Them Because they naturally \ndevise systems, procedures, and schedules, others rely on \nESTJs to take charge and get things done. Others may also \nfind them overpowering at times because ESTJs are so \ncertain about how things should be. Because they are clear \nand straightforward in their communication, people seldom \nhave to wonder where they stand. \n\nESTJs can be quite gregarious and generally enjoy inter- \nacting with people, especially around tasks, games, tradi- \ntions, and family activities. They take relationship roles \n\nseriously and fulfill them responsibly. Others usually see \nESTJs as \n\nW Conscientious and dependable \nB Decisive, outspoken, and self-confident \n\nPotential Areas for Growth Sometimes life circumstances \nhave not supported ESTJs in the development and ex- \npression of their Sensing and Thinking preferences. \n\nB If they have not developed their Sensing, ESTJs may \ndecide too quickly before taking in enough information. \nThen their decisions will reflect their previously formed \njudgments or biases. \n\nB If they have not developed their Thinking, they may not \nhave a reliable way of evaluating information and thus \nend up making inconsistent or overly harsh decisions. \n\nIf ESTJs do not find a place where they can use their gifts \nand be appreciated for their contributions, they usually feel \nfrustrated and may \n\nW Become rigid and dogmatic \n\nB Be intrusive, know-it-all experts, overpowering others \nand refusing to listen \n\nB Get picky about details and be impatient with those who \ndo not follow procedures exactly \n\nIt is natural for ESTJs to give less attention to their non- \npreferred Feeling and Intuitive parts. If they neglect these \ntoo much, however, they may \n\nB Apply logic even when emotions and impacts on people \nneed primary consideration \n\nB Fail to respond to others needs for intimate connection \nand processing of feelings \n\nBW Not always see the wider ramifications of a seemingly \nsimple, direct action \n\nUnder great stress, ESTJs may feel alone and unappreci- \nated and be unable to communicate their feeling of distress \nand despair. \n\nTable +.36 summarizes relevant research results for \nESTJs. Dominant extraverted Thinking types with auxiliary \nintroverted Sensing present quite a different research picture \nfrom that of the ISTP dominant introverted Thinking types \nwith auxiliary extraverted Sensing. The results show ESTJs \nto be contented, to be high on coping resources, and to have \na positive outlook about themselves and the world. How- \never, some results that reflect stress-related behavior differen- \ntiate ESTJs from, for example, ESTPs, in that ESTJs are over- \nrepresented as coronary bypass patients, as showing Type A \nbehavior, among men with chronic pain, and as high in the \nemotional exhaustion aspect of job burnout. It is interesting \nthat they are overrepresented among men who have been \nmarried more than two times and also report high satisfac- \ntion with their current marriage or intimate relationship. \n\nPerhaps these somewhat mixed responses to stress are \npartially a function of some of the other research results \n\nTable 4.36 Research Describing EST] \n\nPersonality, Psychotherapy, \nHealth, Stress, Coping \n\nOverrepresented among men who had been married more than two times \nOne of three least common types among males in substance abuse program \nFemales underrepresented in a substance abuse program \n\nOne of two male types underrepresented in a substance abuse program \n\nUnderstanding the 16 Types 89",

They ean be tough when the situation calls for \ntoughness.

ENT] research results as displayed in Table 4.37 \nshow some general and specific similarities to the data for \nESTJs, as well as quite a few differences that suggest the \ninfluence of the different auxiliary functions, Sensing and \nIntuition. It is quite interesting that there is no overlap in the \n\nUnderstanding the 16 Types  91 \n\nadjectives with which the two types are described, with \nENTJs seen as ambitious, forceful, optimistic, aggressive, \nand egotistical and ESTJs described as contented, energetic, \npractical, prejudiced, and self-satished. (See Chapter 9 for a \nfurther discussion of the distinctive adjectives with which \nthe types are described.) As is found for other types, ENTJs \nare overrepresented among college students referred for sub- \nstance abuse workshops but underrepresented in actual \nsubstance abuse treatment programs. It is interesting that \nESTJs, while similarly uncommon in substance abuse \ngroups, do not seem to be identified as at risk in college. \n\nENTJs are ranked high in coping resources and low in \nreporting stress in several life areas, and unlike ESTJs, who \nreport high job burnout through emotional exhaustion, \nENTJs rank lowest on this variable and are similar to EST]s \non positive and negative alfectivity. \n\nENTJs show success in the educational sphere similar to \nthat of ESTJs, though their academic interests are toward \nEnglish and science, as compared with the EST] interest in \nmath and practical skills. In career variables they show also \nsome type-consistent differences from ESTJs, most notably \nin workplace values and satisfaction, which focus more on \nfuture-oriented and independent pursuits than appears to be \nthe case for the ESTJs. Both types share satisfaction with \ntheir work and working conditions, and ENTJs are among \nthose with the highest salaries. Both types also tend to \ndeal with conflict by competing. \n\nPerhaps even more clearly than is the case for ESTJs, \nENT] research results highlight what is valued, respected, \nand desired in our culture.

With their orienta- \ntion to concrete, straightforward experience and accom- \nplishment in the present, it is not surprising that the aca- \ndemic environment may not be interesting, comfortable, \nand affirming for them. Similarly, few of todays work envi- \nronments permit working steadily on a limited set of tasks, \nnor does the workplace in general reward loyalty and secu- \nrity, simplicity of tasks, and not working overtime. \n\nThe CPI scales that show them as higher on Femininity/ \nMasculinity (reflecting being sympathetic, warm, modest, \nand dependent) and lower on Dominance, and various \nsocial, self-image, and achievement measures are also \nconsistent with the natural approach of ISFPs. \n\nThe interests, competencies, and contributions of ISFPs \nmay not be readily recognized in a context that tends to value \nquite different interests and achievements.

They \nmake a priority of clarifying their values and living in \ncongruence with them. \n\nINFPs recognize and honor the emotional and psycho- \nlogical needs of others, even when others may not have rec- \nognized or expressed their own needs. \n\nCharacteristics of INFPs INFPs primarily use their \nFeeling preference internally where they make decisions \nbased on their values ol self-understanding, individuality, \nand growth. Living by moral commitments to what they \nbelieve in is crucial to INFPs. They are likely to be \n\nB Sensitive, concerned, and caring \nB lIdealistic and loyal to their ideas \n\nINFPs enjoy reading, discussing, and reflecting on possi- \nbilities for positive change in the future.

They are \nadaptable and flexible until something violates their inner \nvalues. Then they stop adapting. The resulting expression of \nvalue judgments can emerge with an intensity that is \nsurprising to others. \n\nINFPs tend to be reserved and selective about sharing \ntheir most deeply held values and feelings. They value rela- \ntionships based on depth, authenticity, true connection, \nand mutual growth. INFPs prize most those who take time \nto understand their values and goals.

Several of the research results reported for ISFPs \nappear for the companion dominant introverted Feeling \ntypes, the INFPs. Males are overrepresented in several sub- \nstance abuse studies. INFPs in general tend to be low in \nassertiveness and positive affectivity, while being the high- \nest type on the negative affectivity scale. They appear infre- \nquently as working MBA students and as owners of small \nbusinesses, have an easygoing leadership style like the \nISFPs, and tend to avoid conflict when presented with it. \n\nA number of dissimilarities to ISFPs are also evident in \ncomparing Tables +.39 and 4.38. Though ISFP males were \nnot very high or low on the Soundness and Efficacy \n(they were fourth lowest on Efficacy) adaptation mea- \nsures, INFP males were the lowest on both of these mea- \nsures. INFP males also showed the highest levels of depres- \nsion and high levels of anger and frustration with chronic \npain, although they were underrepresented as chronie pain \npatients. They also were second lowest in reporting having \nheart disease or hypertension, perhaps suggesting some \nselectivity of this type in their stress-related responses. \n\nAs a type typically seen as serious, contemplative, and \nwith high ideals, it is not surprising that they are the most \nlikely to report suicidal thoughts in college. In contrast to \nISFP college students, and no doubt related to their auxil- \niary Intuition preference, INFPs use of leisure time is over- \nrepresented in activities such as writing, appreciating art, \nreading, and listening to music. INFP career interests and \n\nvalues are also different from those of ISFPs. Creativity is \nthe most important feature of an ideal job, and they are \namong the three highest in wanting independence and \nachievement in their work, as well as autonomy. These \ncareer characteristics may not be readily available to them, \nin that they, like INTPs, report the most dissatisfaction \nwith most aspects of their jobs and report the intention of \nlcaving these jobs. \n\nINFPs are higher on the CPI scales Achievement via Inde- \npendence and Flexibility, and like the ISFPs they are higher \non Femininity/Masculinity and lower on Dominance, Socia- \nbility, Social Presence, Self-Acceptance, Well-Being, Good \nImpression, and Achievement via Conformity. Unlike the \nISFPs, they are also lower on Socialization, Self-Control, and \nCommunality and are not lower on Intellectual Efficiency, \nPsychological-Mindedness, Independence, and Empathy. \n\nThese differences, as well as those relating to educational \ninterests, pinpoint some of the reasons that INFPs may be \nmore readily recognized and appreciated by others than is \nthe case for ISFPs and that may contribute to their more \nmixed responses to life stresses. Nevertheless, the aspects of \nliving and ways of succeeding that give meaning and satis- \nfaction to INFPs are not necessarily reflected in the kinds of \nvariables shown in Table 4.39. The same appears true for \n[SFPs and some of the other types whose natural qualities \nmay be somewhat divergent from those of the larger culture. \n\nESF]: Extraverted Feeling \nwith Introverted Sensing \n\nDominant function: Fg \nAuxiliary function: S \nTertiary function: Nj \n\nFourth/inferior function: T; \n\nAt Their Best People with ESFJ preferences like to or- \nganize people and situations and then work with others to \ncomplete tasks accurately and on time.

This \ndifference in dynamics leads to some striking differences, \nmost notably in the way ESFJs are seen relative to psycho- \nlogical adaptation (males being among the highest on \nSoundness and females among the highest on both \n\"Soundness\" [on which female ISFPs were also high] and \n\"Efficacy\" [where ISFP females were among the lowest]). \nESFJs are underrepresented in substance abuse groups, and \nunlike many other types they were also underrepresented \namong new college students referred to a substance abuse \nworkshop. Apparently ESF] behavior does not raise sub- \nstance abuse concerns among college officials. \n\nIt is curious that one study found males to be underrep- \nresented among men at risk for heart attacks, while \nanother study found women to be the most frequent type \nwith coronary heart disease. Replication and further study \nof this possible gender difference is called for, especially in \nlight of the other results that suggest that ESFJs have a high \nmean level of coping resources, rank highly in using spiri- \ntual/philosophical resources, and are highest in coping with \nstress by relying on religion and by talking to someone else. \nThey were second highest in believing in a higher spiritual \npower and highest in indicating satisfaction with their mar- \nriage or intimate relationship. \n\nESFJs seem to find environments with expectations of \ntoeing the line a comfortable place to work. They are \nattracted to careers in education, health care, and religion, \nthis latter a frequent way of coping with life stress as well. It \nis interesting that ESF} desires for clear structure, loyalty, \nsecurity, and making the job simple may more likely be met \nin the context of their other ESFJ qualities. ISFPs, who \nexpress the same values, may not have the same helpful \ncontext to help meet these desires. Perhaps as a result, \nESF]s appear quite satisfied with many aspects of their \nwork and do not intend to leave their jobs. Important val- \nues for ESFJs are Health and Religion or spirituality, \nwhile they were found lowest in valuing Autonomy, frec- \ndom, and independence. \n\nUnderstanding the 16 Types 99 \n\nTable 4.40 Research Describing ESF} \n\nPersonality, Psychotherapy, Males among three highest onSoundness; females among three highest on \"Soundness\" and \"Efficacy\"! \nHealth, Stress, Coping Underrepresented among female substance abusers? \n\nUnderrepresented among new college students referred for a substance abuse workshop? \n\nMales one of the three least common types in a substance abuse program? \n\nUnderrepresented among females in a substance abuse program? \n\nUnderrepresented among men at risk for heart attack? \n\nMost frequent type among women with coronary heart disease? \n\nWith ENFJs, had the third-highest mean level of coping resources? \n\nWith ENFJs, appeared to be at the lowest risk for setbacks due to overdoing among those with",

They are \nwarmed by approval, responding with energy and devotion, \nand especially sensitive to criticism or tensions. ENFJs are \nlikely to be \n\nB Warm, compassionate, and supportive \nB Loyal and trustworthy \n\nENFJs see meanings and connections and can be very \ninsightful about others. They are curious about new ideas \nand stimulated by possibilities for contributing to the good \nof humanity. ENF]s are likely to \n\nB Be imaginative and creative \nW [ike variety and new challenges \n\nENFJs naturally see the potential for growth in others \nand devote energy to help others achieve it. They are sensi- \ntive facilitators. ENFJs take responsibility to organize inter- \nactions of colleagues, friends, or family so that all are \ninvolved, harmony prevails, and people have fun. \n\nHow Others May See Them ENFJs are energetic, \nenthusiastic, and very aware of others. Their genuine in- \nterest can usually draw out and involve even the most re- \nserved person. They listen to and support others but also \nhave very definite values and opinions of their own, which \nthey will express clearly. ENFJs are energized by people and \nare socially adept; however, thev also have a strong need for \nauthentic, intimate relationships. They bring great \nenthusiasm and intensity to creating and maintaining these. \n\nENE]Js like their lives to be organized and will work to \nbring closure to ambiguous relationships or situations. \nHowever, if peoples needs conflict with schedules and \nrules, they will put people first. Others usually see ENFJs as \n\nB Sociable, personable, congenial, and gracious \nWB Expressive, responsive, and persuasive \n\nPotential Areas for Growth Sometimes life circumstances \nhave not supported ENFJs in the development and ex- \npression of their Intuitive and Feeling preferences. \n\nB If they have not developed their Intuition, ENFJs may \nnot see possibilities, making decisions too quickly with- \nout taking in enough information or considering factors \nbeyond their own personal values. \n\nm i they have not developed their Feeling, their decisions \nmay be inconsistent and poorly formulated. They may \nthen accept the judgments of others too readily. \n\nIf ENFJs do not find a place where they can use their \ngifts and be appreciated for their contributions, they usually \nfeel frustrated and may \n\nW Worry, feel guilty, and doubt themselves \n\nB Become insistent and controlling in their desire for har- \nmony \n\nB Be overly sensitive to criticism, real or imagined \n\nIt is natural for ENFJs to give less attention to their non- \npreferred Thinking and Sensing parts. If they neglect these \ntoo much, however, they may \n\nB Make decisions based solely on personal values when \nlogic is needed also \n\n@ Find it difficult to admit to problems or disagreements \nwith people they care about \n\nB Overlook details required to realize their ideals \n\nUnder great stress, ENFJs may find themselves suddenly \nand uncharacteristically critical and fault-finding with oth- \ncrs. They generally kcep these negative opinions to them- \nselves, but they find such thoughts troubling and upsetting. \n\nTable 4.41 summarizes relevant research results for ENFJs. \nLike ESFJs, ENFJs seem to be well in accord with societal \nvalues and expectations. Male ENFJs are among the highest \non the \"Efficacy\" measure of adaptation rather than the \n\"Soundness\" measure observed for ESF] males, and females \nare similar to ESF] females in being high on both measures. \n\nUnderstanding the 16 Types 101 \n\na e M  \n\nTable 4.41 Research Describing ENF] \n\nPersonality, Psychotherapy, Active, pleasant, sociable, demanding, impatient! \n\nHealth, Stress, Coping Males among three highest on Efficacy; females among three highest on \"Soundness\" and \"Efficacy\"? \n\nWith ESFjs, had the third-highest mean level of coping resources? \n\nWith ESF|s, appeared to be at the lowest risk for setbacks due to overdoing among those with long-term \npain \n\nHighest ranks on coping resources used were social and cognitive (ranked third on both among the 16 \n\ntypes); ranked third in total resources of the 16 types? \n\nOne of the four types in college reporting the highest levels of assertiveness? \n\nIn national sample, highest in coping with stress by \"Exercising\"* \n\nIn national sample, ranked highest in Belief in a higher spiritual power\"? \n\nRanked fourth lowest on \"Depersonalization\" burnout scale? \n\nRanked third highest in \"Positive affectivity\" and second lowest in \"Negative affectivity\"*",

ENFJs \nare higher on Changeable, Forceful, and Initiating, as com- \npared with the ESF] high standing on Appreciative, Compro- \nmising, Delegating, Fair, and Supportive. Like ESFJs, how- \never, ENFJs tend to compromise in conflict situations. \n\nENFJs appear from these research data to have many of \nthe people-oriented, cooperative qualities of ESFJs but also \nappear to enjoy more future-oriented, broad ranging inter- \nests that make them seem more ambitious and individualis- \ntic in their approach. In contrast to INFPs, whose dominant \nFeeling function is introverted and whose auxiliary Intuition \nis extraverted, ENFJs have desires, competencies, and satis- \nfactions that appear to conform well to what is recognized \nand valued in the larger culture. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe foregoing descriptions and supporting research show \nhow particular patterns that appear in the type table and the \n16 types themselves can be studied and interpreted. The \ndescriptions of two-letter combinations and whole types \ncontained in this chapter are not exhaustive but aim to pro- \nvide the essential features that make preference combina- \ntions and types recognizable and meaningful. \n\nResearch results in particular should be viewed as sug- \ngestive rather than definitive. The discussions of each \nresearch table sometimes include suggestions about the \nrationale for and implications of research results. It is \nimportant to view these suggestions as hypotheses that \nrequire careful empirical research and observation. ft is \nequally important to be cautious in generalizing any of the \nresearch results to individuals of anv type, especially in \noverinterpreting both \"positive\"-seeming and negative- \nappearing characteristics. Bear in mind that many of the \nvariables that appear in these research tables are traits with \nexplicit or implicit positive or negative values associated \nwith particular scores. For example, it is clearly better to \nbe higher on measures of adaptation than lower, better to be \nlow on the various stress indicators than to be high, better \nto have many coping resources than few, better to be *cre- \native,\" obtain high grades, be socially at ease and achieve- \nment oriented, and so on. \n\nReaders may have noted that although single prefer- \nences and/or combinations of preferences may account for \nsome of the effects reported for each type, the unique com- \nbination of effects shown, even given the reporting con- \nstraints listed earlier, can best be understood within the \ncontext of the dynamic whole type. Practitioners and \nresearchers may find it intriguing that some types who \nshare the same dominant function in the same attitude \nshow quite similar research results, while for others the \ndifferent auxiliary functions appear to produce marked dif- \nferences. If this is not an artifact resulting from the particu- \nlar variables reviewed, it implies even greater complexity \nand uniqueness to the type system for describing and \nexplaining personality. \n\nPractitioners and researchers might also take note of the \nobservation made in the discussion of ISTPs, where it was \nsuggested that the same behavior can be motivated differ- \nently for different types, and that each type may fulfill the \nsame needs and desires through quite different behaviors. It \nis useful to take this into account when trying to under- \nstand type similarities and differences. \n\nOne important result of presenting descriptions of the \ntype combinations and types together with observational \nand research data is that it highlights the fact that for type \ntheory and the MBTI, the whole is greater than the sum of \nthe parts. Researchers can thus be further encouraged to \nstudy whole types and type dynamic groupings to yield \nmeaningful and useful results. The conjunction of theory, \nobservational data, and research evidence provides a unique \nopportunity to look at the breadth and depth of type influ- \nences in many areas of human functioning. This approach \nto type knowledge also affirms the reality of psychological \ntypes as dynamic wholes that have an important unifying \nimpact on our individual personalities. \n\nAdministration \nand Interpretation Il \n\nhe two chapters in Part IIl represent Myers and \n\nBriggs overriding reason for developing the \nMBTIthe desire to make psychological type theory use- \nful in the lives of individuals and groups.

In a very real way, all of the \ninformation in the manual is in support of accurate inter- \npretations that focus on the value of the MBTI to the \nclient. A major portion of the chapter is devoted to a dis- \ncussion of ways in which practitioners can help clients \nverify their type so that it can become beneficial to them \nin their everyday lives. As you rcad Chapter 6, you will \nbecome aware of the following: \n\nBW There are important distinctions between reported type, \nbest-fit type, and true type. \n\nB The percentage of people who agree with their reported \ntype tends to vary depending on the group being studied \nand the methodology that is used. \n\nB [t is important to allow people to self-assess their type \nbefore providing them with MBTI results. \n\nB It is important to include some basic information about \ntype dynamics and development in every interpretation \nsession. \n\nB Respondents should be made aware that the MBTI sorts \npeople into qualitatively different categories rather than \nmeasuring how much ol some trait they have. \n\nReaders of Chapter 6 should be particularly attentive to the \nrecommended language for explaining type to clients. The \nlanguage guidelines used throughout the manual are designed \nto discourage the use ol jargonlike terms that negatively affect \nthe credibility and professional purposes of the MBTI. The \nuse of certain shorthand terms also encourages stercotyping \nand a nothing-but interpretation of type and type prefer- \nences. For example, referring to a person who prefers Feeling \nas a Feeler can be seen to imply that the person exclusively \nfeels and never thinks. Use of such a term also increases \nthe likelihood that the hearer wil! misinterpret Feeler as \nmeaning a person who is emotional.\" Readers are encour- \naged to peruse the Glossary at the end of the manual as a way \nol becoming aware of terminological usages that lend them- \nselves to steteotyping and misinterpretation. \n\nAdministering the MBTI \n\nAppropriate Populations \nfor Administration \n\nSelection of the Appropriate Form \nGaining Respondent Cooperation \nIntroducing the MBTI \n\nGuidelines During Administration \nScoring the MBTI Form M \n\nConclusion \n\nith all self-report instruments, it is important to \n\ncreate an atmosphere that ensures consistency \nof instructions, conditions, handling of respondent ques- \ntions, and other administrative variables in order to obtain \naccurate reports. Particular care is warranted when admin- \nistering the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator personality inven- \ntory because it seeks to maximize the respondents freedom \nto reveal personality preferences rather than skills, abilities, \nor simple attitudes. In answering cach question, respon- \ndents must choose between opposite aspects of personality, \neach of which they use at least some of the time; careful \nattention to administrative concerns is therefore encour- \naged. This chapter covers administration guidelines that are \napplicable in all settings and for all or most respondents. \nSpecial administration issues relevant to particular uses of \nthe MBTI assessment tool arc discussed in the appropriate \n\napplication chapters (Chapters 10-14). \n\n106 Administration and Interpretation \n\nAppropriate Populations \nfor Administration \n\nThe MBTI varies in the extent to which it is suitable for dit- \nferent kinds of respondents. This section discusses ages \nappropriate for administration, reading levels required, and \ntranslations. \n\nAppropriate Age Groups \n\nThe original research for the MBTI measured the responses \nof a variety of populations from fourth-grade students to \nmature adults. When using the MBTI with high school stu- \ndents and adults who can read at least at the eighth-grade \nlevel, a professional can be reasonably confident of the \nreported type for individual guidance, provided that the \nreported type is never used as an established fact but rather",

Be sure to exercise caution in interpreting \nresults with 12- and 13-year-old students; according to the- \nory, type is less developed in young people than in mature \nindividuals. Younger students are likely to have less com- \nplete and confident knowledge of themselves and therefore \nare less able to report about the attitudes and behaviors that \nunderlie their personality preferences. This theoretical \nassumption is supported by the generally lower reliabilities \nfound for younger respondents (see Chapter 8). However, if \nyou are careful, you can successfully test younger people \nand provide them with information about their type. \nResults for younger people may also be used for research \nthat explores type differences in interests or learning styles. \nYou can effectively elicit type for students ages 7 through 12 \nusing the Murphy-Meisgeir Type Indicator for Children \n(MMTIC), for which there is a separate manual (Meisgeier \n&amp; Murphy, 1987). \n\nReading Levels Required \n\nThe reading level of a set of items can be approximately \ndetermined using a variety of approaches (DeVellis, 1991). \nHowever, conventional methods for assessing reading diffi- \nculty were not designed for test items, particularly an \ninventory that mixes forced-choice items and word pairs. \nSyntactic and semantic factors within the itemsfor exam- \nple, simple versus complex sentence structure, the fact that \ncach phrase item actually forms two sentences, and the \ncontext of the words for the readerwill affect reading lev- \nels that are based on formulas of sentence and word length. \nI hus, you should use common sense when determining the \nappropriateness of the MBTI for various populations. \n\nThe phrase items for Form M were analyzed using the \nFry readability lormula, which uses the average number of \nsentences and syllables in 100-word samples to assign \n\napproximate grade equivalents to written passages (Fry, \n1977). This method vields a reading level of about seventh \ngrade (approximately 12- to 13-year-olds) by treating each \nitem as a single sentence.! Remember, however, that read- \ning level is only an approximation and is not a substitute for \nknowing your clients well enough to assess the suitability \nof administering the MBTI to them. \n\nAvailable Translations \n\nJungs theory is an attempt to describe basic human mental \n\nprocesses that cut across cultural differences. It is therefore \nreasonable to expect to find evidence of the existence of \ntype and type differences in a wide range of cultures and \ncountries. There are currently 14 commercial translations \nfor which reliability and validity evidence are available and \n15 additional translations listed as research instruments. Suc- \ncessfully translating the MBTI is a lengthy and arduous task \ndue to the need to take into account cultural and language \ndifferences that affect item content and meaning. The pro- \ncedure essentially requires repeating many of the steps \nIsabel B. Myers undertook in developing the original MBTI \npersonality inventory. For further information on transla- \ntions and issues in translating, see Chapter 14 of this man- \nual and Kirby and Barger (1996). Translating into diverse \nlanguages is an ongoing process. For information on the \nstatus of translations into particular langnages, contact the \npublisher, Consulting Psychologists Press. \n\nSelection of the Appropriate Form \n\nSeveral forms of the MBTI are available, all of which pro- \nvide basic four-letter type information. These forms differ \nin the amount and kind of additional information provided. \nIn selecting a form, consider the purpose of using the \nMBTI, the time available for testing, and the testing situa- \ntion. Basic information about the forms appears in Table \n5.1. Note that where indicated, computer scoring services \nand scoring software are available from the publisher. \norm V is now the standard form t epl  ad _As \ndetailed in Chapter 2, Form M contains the newest items, \nthe most precise scoring procedure, and the most current \nstandardization samples to produce scoring weights. \nAmong other improvements over previous forms, this form \nwas designed to maximize precision of preference identifi- \ncation at the midpoint of each dichotomy and to eliminate \nthe need for separate scoring keys for males and females. \nForm M and Form M self-scorable each contain 93 \nitems, all of which are scored for tvpe.

For more information, consult \nthe manuals for these scoring methods. \n\nVarious profiles and reports are generated by the differ- \nent forms of the MBTI. Table 5.2 identifies these and shows \nthe form or forms of the MBTI that produce particular pro- \nfiles and reports. \n\nthat may or may not be revealed by a measurement device. \nAs such, the type reported by an individual on the MBTI or \nin using any other assessment method is always considered \n\n\" | / \nto be a hypothesis rather than a fact. Best-fit type is the i \n\ntype verified by the respondent after participating in an \ninterpretation session with a qualified professional, reading - \nalternative type descriptions, or using other verification \n\n108 \n\nAdministration and Interpretation \n\nprocedures. Studies of best-fit type in relation to reported \ntype are discussed in Chapters 2, 6, and 7. \n\nYou can maximize accurate assessment of type through \nthe Indicator by attending to several administrative issues \nboth before and during administration. In addition to the \ngeneral guidelines discussed here, each area of application \nof the MBTI may have special administration issues. These \narc discussed in the relevant chapters in Part V. \n\nThe MBTI differs from many personality measures in \nthat the results are designed primarily for respondents. \nHowever, many people who take the instrument are un- \naware af its differences from other personality measures. \nTherefore it is important to explain these differences prior \nto administration. \n\nThe practitioner should strive to create an atmosphere in \nwhich individuals are interested in their results, can re- \nspond freely to the items, and can feel confident that the \nresults are for their own purposes, not for the benefit of \nother people. The MBTI items are reasonably transparent, \nand answers can be falsified. Using the MBTI for purposes \nsuch as job selection and advancement is therefore inappro- \npriate, as respondents can easily answer the items so as to \nappear to be the type favored for a particular job or position \nwithin an organization. The MBTI can, however, be suc- \ncessfully included as part of the battery of tools typically \nused in personnel assessments. In such an application, the",

Practitioners should also be aware that the \nresponsibility for using an instrument lor assessment pur- \nposes lies with them as users. \n\nPractitioners are responsible for being familiar with their \nown state guidelines on using an instrument for assessment \npurposes and with the intentions and wordings of the Ameri- \ncans with Disabilities Act, Civil Rights Act, Title VII, and other \nlegislation dealing with privacy issues. \n\nTo minimize false responses, practitioners should pro- \nvide respondents at the outset with consistent information \nabout the voluntary nature of the testing process, the nature \nof the instrument, the purpose for which it is being admin- \nistered, and the confidentiality of results. Thus potential \nrespondents should be informed of the following: \n\nTaking the MBTI is voluntary. Respondents who are \nrequired to take the instrument or who are subject to any \nform of coercion, such as employer or peer-group pressure \nto participate in the testing process, are unlikely to provide \naccurate results. Practitioners can increase respondent co- \noperation by assuring them that taking the Indicator is vol- \nuntary. In addition, the information below can often prove \npersuasive. \n\nThe MBTI does not assess mental or emotional health. The \nmost accurate way of describing the nature of the MBTI is to \n\n- major feature of Ye the MBTI is th \n\ntell respondents that it looks at naturally varying preferences \nin the way people take in information and make decisions; \nit does not reflect intelligence, competence, or mental \nhealth. With the proliferation of tests to measure a wide \nvariety of competencies and mental or emotional disorders, \nrespondents may be understandably concerned about what \nthe Indicator will reveal about them. It may therefore be \nuseful to point out to respondents that the MBTI items do \nnot reflect competence or mental health because the items \nwere not designed for these purposes. \n\nIhe results belong to the respondent. The MBTI is primar- \nily for the benefit of the individual respondent and serves \nthat persons purpose. Purposes can involve applications \nsuch as career advisement, learning strategies, couples ther- \napy, and team building. (See application chapters for useful \nways of explaining the purposes of the MBTI in each area.) \nWhere the MBTI assessment tool is administered solely for \nresearch purposes, researchers might wish to offer respon- \ndents personal feedback so they can verify individual re- \nsults. Such a practice can increase cooperation and allow \nfor more accurate data. pe \" \n\nT he respondent is the judge of the accuracy of results. A \nractice of having \neach respon | results. When peo- \nple know that they will be told the results and invited to \nconfirm or correct the report of their type, their answers are \nmore likely to be genuine. \n\nAn individuals MBTI results are confidential. Respon- \ndents in a variety of circumstances have legitimate con- \ncerns about who will have access to their MBTI results and \nhow such information will be used. Providing assurances \nthat results will not be released without the respondents \npermission can alleviate such concerns. Confidentiality \ncan be an especially significant issue when the MBII is \nadministered in a work environment. See Chapter 13 for \ndetailed recommendations. \n\nIntroducing the MBTI \n\nWhen introducing the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator person- \nality inventory, do not call it a test; instead refer to it as \nthe MBTI, the Indicator, or the Myers-Briggs personality \ninventory or questionnaire. Emphasize the fact that the \nMBTI is designed to indicate equally valuable preferences \nand does not have right and wrong answers, as do achieve- \nment tests. \n\nSome people have trouble adito the right mind-set for \nanswering the MBTI. The setting in which they answer the \nquestions may influence them to report their work self, \n\"school self,\" *ideal self,\" or some other self that is specific \nto external demands. Preferably, their frame of reference \nshould reflect how they function most naturally, smoothly, \nand effortlessly, when they are not going against the \n\ngrain.\" Practitioners often use the term shoes-off self, but in \nsome settings this expression might be interpreted nega- \ntively, for example in the military, where it may mean \nbeing lazy. \n\nWhen asking respondents to take the MBTI, consider \nthe probable type of the individual client or the likely distri- \nbution of types in the group. Sensitivity to the following can \nalso increase cooperation: \n\nBW Sensing types will want to know that the information \nwill have some practical value. \n\nB Intuitive types will want to see possible future benefits. \nThey may also find the choice between alternatives frus-",

It helps \nto acknowledge the skepticism and suggest they wait \nand see. \n\nm Introverted types can be expected to be concerned with \nprivacy issues and whether they may unknowingly \nreveal sensitive personal information. Administrators \ncan assure them that the MBTI will not reveal anything \nhidden or negative about them. It will instead organize \ninformation they already know about themselves so as to \nprovide an interesting and useful way of understanding \nthemselves and others. \n\nThe MBTI is virtually self-administering. All necessary \ninstructions are given on the cover of the question booklets \nand on the response sheets. In appropriate circumstances, \nrespondents may be given or sent the question booklet and \nanswer sheet for Forms M, G, K, or J to fill out and return \nfor scoring. However, the subsequent verification and inter- \npretation process should not be done through the mail or \nsolely by providing written results without a professional \ninterpreter. \n\nNote that Form M self-scorable and Form G self-scorable are \nintended for use primarily with groups where administration \ntime is an issue and circumstances do not permit prior \nadministration and scoring. In line with the guidelines for \ninterpretation given in Chapter 6, respondents should not be \npermitted to self-score the instrument before the interpreter \nprovides them with information about type. Respondents \nshould be encouraged to double-check their scoring to \nreduce the chance of error. \n\nRegardless of the circumstances in which the MBTI is \nadministered, the following should be reinforced, since \nmany respondents read the instructions on the test booklet \nin a cursory fashion or not at all: \n\nB Remember there are no right or wrong answers. \n\nB It is best not to think too long about any question; your \nfirst response is likely to be most true for you. \n\nB If you cannot decide on a question, skip it. \n\nAdministering the MBTI 109 \n\nGuidelines During Administration \n\nWhen administering the MBTI, these guidelines should be \nfollowed: \n\nB Inform the individual that the MBTI has no time limit. \n\nThose who are making unusually slow progress, how- \never, may be encouraged to work more rapidly and not \nstudy the items at length. \n\nB In administering the MBTI to poor readers or younger \n\nchildren, it may be preferable to read the questions \naloud; in reading, the examiner should be sure to sound \nopen-minded and unbiased about both choices. \n\nB When administering forms M, G, k, and J to students \n\nbelow age 17, inform them that many of the questions \nwere originally written for adults and they are not \nexpected to be able to answer every one. However, \nencourage them to answer all questions if they are able. \n\n.plai | ; | ol words to \ndo not allow group mem- \n\nnot explain questions or meanings c \ndents. In group testing, \ns to discuss the items. \nWhen conducting group administration of the MBTI, \nread the instructions aloud, emphasizing the need for \ncarefully filling in the identifying information. Note that \na separate item booklet and answer sheet are provided \nfor template scoring of Form M, so respondents should \nbe careful to match numbers on the answer sheet to the \nnumbers in the item booklet. Computer scoring of Form \nM requires administration of a single form that incorpo- \nrates both questions and responses. The self-scorable \nforms also combine questions and answers in one form. \nMake sure to use the form that corresponds to the scor- \ning method you plan to use. \n\nWB Omissions should be encouraged only if respondents do \n\nnot understand a question or cannot choose an answer \n\nbecause neither choice is more appealing or descriptive of \n\nthem than the other. The reason for permitting omissions \nis that no item can reliably contribute useful evidence of \ntype unless choices are understood and the question lies \nwithin the respondents experience. Information about \npercentages of omissions on Form M can be found in \nChapter 7. In actual practice, only about 5% of respon- \ndents omit more than two items. However, where there \nare more than four.omissions on the E-1 or J-P \ndichotomy and more than five omissions on the S-N or \nT-F dichotomy, questions arise about the interpretability \nof those results. When Form M is computer scored, omis- \nsions exceeding these are flagged and a comment recom- \nmends caution in interpretation. Practitioners who use \nscoring templates should check answer sheets that con- \ntain more than three omissions overall to determine \nwhether the omissions exceed the limits on any one \ndichotomy or are spread evenly throughout. Interpreta- \ntion should proceed cautiously where the number of \nomissions on any dichotomy is excessive. \n\n110 \n\nAdministration and Interpretation \n\n = = ee  -  0",

    "content": "g When using thc Indicator in work situations, be alert to \nemployee concerns about the demographic question \nrelated to employee satisfaction, which is asked so that \nresearch on job satisfaction can be carried out. Some \nrespondents may be concerned that the information on \nsatisfaction will be relayed to their superiors. However, if \nanswer sheets are handled with proper attention to \nissues ol confidentiality, this should not be an issue. An \nexplanation of confidentiality procedures should be pro- \nvided to respondents. But if their concern persists, they \ncan be told to skip that demographic question. \n\nScoring the MBTI Form M \n\nForm M is the revised version of Form G. The similarities \nand differences between the two forms are presented in \nChapter 2 of this manual. Because of the differences, the \nresults for the two forms may differ as well (see Chapter 7 \nlor data on the statistical relationship betwcen Forms G and \nM). For the purpose of understanding the scoring lor Form \nM, rwo differences are worth repeating herc: \n\nm Separate scoring lor males and females on the T-F \ndichotomy is not used on Form M. \n\nm Respondents are permitted to mark only one of the two \nchoices provided for each question (there are a number of \nitems on Form G with more than two response choices). \n\nResults for Forms M and G may differ because the two forms \n\nare based on different items, scoring weights, and scoring \nprocedures. \n\nSelf-scoring, template (hand) scoring, prepaid (mail-in) \nscoring, and on-site software scoring with the CPP Software \nSystem are all available for Form M, as they are for Form G. \nThis section presents the instructions for scoring the self- \nscorable and template versions of Form M and provides a \nbrief discussion of the software scoring. Users should be \naware that templates are also available for scoring prepaid \nversions of Form M.  set of eight templates, onc for cach \npreference, is required. \n\nThe prepaid (mail-in) scoring and the on-site softwarc \nscoring options for Form M use itcm response theory to \nderive the persons preferences, type, and prehcrence clarity \nindexes. These IRI-based procedures yield the most precise \nclassification of a respondents preferences on the four \ndichotomies. Both scoring options also allow practitioners \nto generate their own detailed, computer-scored reports, \nwhich are listed in Table 5.2. The kinds of scores available \nfrom the mail-in scoring and the software, and a discussion \nof IRT scoring, are found in Chapter 7. The instructions for \nscoring Form G and for converting Form G raw scores to \npreference scores and continuous scores can be found in \nthe 1985 MBTI Manual. \n\nBoth the template and self-scorable versions of Form M \nuse unit weighting. So, unlike with Form G, there are no \nseparate weights for each item response. Each response is \ncounted as one point. A persons preference on a given scale \nis therefore the pole of the dichotomy that he or she chose \n\nmost often. The advantage of using unit weighting is thes, \n\nsimplicity of both the interpretation and the scoring, both \nimportant considerations when the MBTI is being used in a \nworkshop or group setting when quick results are needed. \nHowever, unit weights are not as precise or accurate as thc \nIRT method used with computer scoring because on the \ntemplate and self-scorable versions, all items are considcred \nto have equal amounts of information. On the computer- \nscored versions (prepaid mail-ins and on-site software), on \nthe other hand, maximum use is made of all the informa- \ntion available from cach item. Items that do a better job of \nseparating people into opposite preferences receive more \nweight. So, for those who wish the most precise scoring, \none of the computer-scored versions is required. \n\nTemplate Scoring of Form M \n\nTemplate scoring of Form M is accomplished using four tem- \nplates, one for each of the E-I, S-N, T-F J-P dichotomies. \nSeparate scoring keys for males and females are not used \nwith Form M. The TF template can be used for both sexes. \nThe procedure for scoring is as follows: \n\n1. Place the template over the answer sheet, matching \nthe square openings on the template to the asterisks \non both sides of the answer sheet. This will expose \nthe answers marked for E, S, T, or J, whichever tem- \nplate is being used. \n\n. Count the number of answers showing through the \nopenings in the template to obtain the raw points for \nE, S, T, or J, whichever template is being used. Write \nthe raw points for this scale in the space provided on \nthe answer shect. \n\n3. Move the template to the left, matching the square \nopenings on the template to the asterisks on both sides \nof the answer sheet. This will expose the answers \nmarked for I, N, E or P, whichever template is being \nused. \n\n4.

Read across to the right column and identify the \npreference clarity category associated with that value. \nThe preference clarity categories are slight, moder- \nate,\" \"clear,\" and very clear\" (see Chapter 6 for how \nto interpret these categories). \n\nAnswering and Scoring \nthe Self-Scorable Form M \n\nThe procedure when using the self-scorable form of the \nMBTI is as follows: \n\n1. Read each question and mark an X in the appropriate \nbox. After all questions have been answered, open the \nperforation and turn the page. \n\nReading across each row, count the number of marks in \n\neach of the boxes in that row. Enter the total in the \n\nshaded box to the right of the row. Do this for each row. \n\n3. Next, read down each column and add all the num- \nbers in that column. Enter the total in the box at the \nbottom of the column. These numbers are the raw \npoints for each preference. \n\n4. For each dichotomy separately, look at the raw points \nfor each pole and determine which has the largest \npoint value. Write the letter of the preference with the \nlargest point value. If the raw points are equal, write I, \nN, F or P, depending on the dichotomy. \n\n5. [Optional] H you wish additional information about \nthe clarity of your preference on each dichotomy, use \nthe conversion table. For each dichotomy, identify the \nhighest raw point value, and then in the hrst column \nof the conversion table, find the range that contains \nthis raw point value. Then read across to the second \ncolumn and identify the preference clarity category \n(slight, moderate, clear, or very clear\") associ- \nated with this value. (See Chapter 6 for how to inter- \npret these categories). If the raw points are equal, just \nlook up that number tn the table. \n\nI \n\nAn Example of Template- and \nSelf-Scorable Form M Results \n\nAn example of a persons results as they would appear on \neither the template- or sclf-seorable versions of Form M \nappears in Table 5.3, and preference clarity category con- \nversion tables for all four scales appear in Table 5.4. The \nperson whose scores are shown in Table 5.3 answered 20 of \nthe 21 items on the E-I dichotomy in the E direction (there \nwere 20 marks showing through the E part of the template, \nor there were 20 marks in the E column on the self- \nscorable), and therefore his raw points for E are 20. Repeat- \ning the scoring procedure with either the I portion of the \ntemplate or the I column on the self-seorable, we find that \nthe point value for is 1. Because the raw points are 20 for E \nand | for I, the preference letter is E, which is entered on \nthe top line of the results box on the template scoring sheet \nunder \"Preference.\" \n\nOf course, knowing the total number of items on each \nscale allows you or the respondent to use subtraction to \ndetermine the raw points for the other preference on a \ngiven dichotomy, once the raw point value for the first pref- \nerence is known. In this example, knowing that there are 21 \nitems on the E-I scale and then subtracting the 20 raw \npoints for E leaves 1 as the raw point value for l. It is recom- \nmended, however, that you also use both portions of the \ntemplate for each scale, or count down both columns of the \nself-scorable, as a check on the accuracy of your counts. \n\nThe Form M template- and sell-scorable versions empha- \nsize the identification of the four preferences that yield a \npersons type. Determination of preference clarity through \nthe preference clarity category (pee) is optional when using \nthese forms. The most important aim of emphasizing the \npreference rather than any estimate of the clarity of the pref- \nerence is to discourage misinterpretation of the MBTI. \n\nPractitioners and clients who want an estimate of pref-",

Follow the same procedure for the preferences shown \non each of the remaining three dichotomies. \n\n. The reason for deemphasizing scores on the MBTI is that \nscores are somctimes viewed as reflecting traits that identify \ngreater or lesser proficiency, maturity, or accessibility of a \npreference. \n\nMake sure clients clearly understand that the focus is on \nthe direction of the preference. The preference clarity cate- \ngories, like the more precise prefcrence clarity index that \nresults from computer scoring, do not reflect competence, \nmaturity, or ease of access to their preferences. Even the pci, \nlike its predecessor, the preference score, shows only how \nconsistently a person answered the questions in the direc- \ntion of the preferred pole of a dichotomy. \n\nUsing Results for Research Purposes \n\n[t is recommended that researchers use one of the computer- \nscored versions (prepaid mail-in or software) of Form M \nwhen the goal is to usc scores for research purposes. This \nwill allow the usc of the @ scores that result from the IRT \nscoring, which are the most precise scores available. (It is \n\nnot recommended that the pci be used because preference \nclarity indexes have a more restricted range, which will \nresult in attenuated correlations.) Note that using continu- \nous scores for research is contradictory to the dichotomous \nnature of the MBTI. It does, however, allow investigators to \nexamine rclationships between single MBTI dichotomies \nand the many traits measured by other instruments using \ncommon quantitative statistical procedures. Be cautious in \ninterpreting such results because the correlational method is \nnot consistent with type theory. A preferred alternative to \nusing continuous scores would be to use whole types, the \npreferences, or the preference clarity categories as indepen- \ndent variables. This would also allow for results from the \ntemplate- and self-scorable versions of Form M to be used \nlor research. These results can be examined using categorical \nanalyses that are more congruent with type theory. See Chap- \nter 9 for a more thorough discussion of issues associated \nwith analyses of MBTI scores. \n\nSoftware \n\nThe CPP Software System, which uses a Microsoft? Win- \ndows? environment, is available under license from the \npublisher for total on-site management of the MBTI. This \nsystem provides three options for MBTI online administra- \ntion: the items presented to the client on the computer \nscreen; a printed item booklet/answer sheet followed by \nkey-in of the clients responses; an item booklet/answer \nsheet that can be scanned into the computer on-site. \n\nOnce the clients responses have been entered into the \ncomputer using onc of these three methods, the profes- \nsional can select the reports desired for immediate printing, \nlor example the MBTI Interpretive Report or the MBTI \nCareer Report. The software provides local customer op- \ntions for printing. \n\nTo facilitate not only the selection and preparation of the \nappropriate reports but also thc management ol client infor- \nmation, client information and item responses are collected \ninto a database. [n addition, the database will help the pro- \n[cssional track the administrations of the MBTI and other \nassessment tools that are available through the system (e.g., \nthe Strong Interest Inventory, the California Psychological \nInventory, and the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Ori- \ncntation-Behavior\"\" [FIRO-B\"\" D). \n\nThe client software module (the part of the software sys- \ntem used by the client when taking the items online) can be \nnetworked or installed from a floppy disk for administra- \ntion of the MBTI at multiple computers.

Results for this group were comparable \nto those for the U.S. samples. Note that in all four studies, \nForm G was used. Table 9.17 in Chapter 9 provides addi- \ntional information about reported and best-fit type studies. \n\nBoth the Walck and the Hammer and Yeakley studies \nverify practitioner experience in finding that discrepancies \nbetween reported and best-fit type occur most frequently \nfor dichotomies on which initial reported clarity of prefer- \nence is slight. A slight preference means that the respondent \nhas split his or her vote, answering about half the items \nfavoring each pole of the dichotomy. Analysis using Cohen's \nkappa (a measure of the agreement between two ratings) \nfor the Kummerow study and the Hammer and Yeakley \nstudy as low and high estimates reveals a range from kappa \n= .59 as the low estimate to kappa = .79 as the high esti- \nmate, where kappa of 0 = no agreement and kappa of 1.00 = \nperfect agreement. Another way of interpreting the above \nreported and verified type data is to bear in mind that the \nexpected agreement for any one of the 16 categories by \nchance alone is only 6.25%. The figures in Table 6.1, there- \nfore, greatly exceed chance expectation. \n\nAlthough interpreting and verifying type results are \nimportant even when respondents report clear preferences, \na major task in interpretation is to help respondents with \nless clear reported preferences arrive at a comfortable and \naccurate assessment of their type. This is accomplished in \nan interpretation session mainly through an exploration of \nhow type preferences appear in client behaviors. \n\nIntroducing the Interpretation \n\nInterpretation of MBTI results should be a joint process \nbetween the professional giving the interpretation and the \nrespondent reacting. The interpreter should never say flatly, \nYou are such and such a type.

The reported \ntype should be submitted to the respondents judgment \nwith statements such as, This shows how you answered. \nDoes it describe you, or does it fit you?\" \n\nAs with any self-report instrument, the accuracy of the \nresults depends in part on how willing or able the person is \nto self-report his or her preferences. If people answering the \nMBTI inventory feel that they have nothing to gain, they \nmay answer carelessly or even at random. If they fear they \nhave something to lose, thev may answer as they assume \nthey should. Many of the administration recommendations \nin the preceding chapter are wavs of maximizing the accu- \nracy of self-report. However, should there be reason to \nbelieve that a respondent did not answer candidly, appropri- \nate inquiry might be made. \n\nEssential Points to Make to Clients \n\nIt is strongly recommended that respondents self-assess their \n\npreferences prior to being provided with their MBTI results. \n\nThe following eight points are basic information for an initial \ninterpretation session either with individuals or in a group \nsetting. Incorporating them into the feedback plan ensures \nthat a cooperative and collegial tone will be maintained \nthroughout the interpretation and verification process. It is",

This \nsequence increases understanding, conveys respect for the \nindividuals self-knowledge, and discourages respondents \nfrom agreeing too readily with their reported type. \n\nI. No questions, however accurate, can lead to answers \nthat explain all human complexity. The MBTI results \ngive the respondent and the interpreter a hypothesis \nabout an individual's type. As such, the results are a \nfirst step toward understanding the respondents true \nor best-fit type. \n\n. Each item in the MBTI requires the respondent to \nmake a choice between two opposite alternatives. \n\nIN \n\nThese choices may seem difficult because they all \ndescribe activities that are necessary and valuable. \nSuch choices are more difficult than choices betwcen \nthings considered good or bad. It is often useful to \ndescribe the process of responding to the MBTI as one \nof casting votes in four elections, each with two \ngood candidates. \n\n3. The terms and letters may seem a little strange at first, \nbut the behaviors described by those terms typically \nare familiar to the respondent. \n\n4. The MBTI is an \"indicator,\" not a test. There are no \nright or wrong answers. There are also no good or \nbad, or sick or well, types. All types are valuable. \n\n5. Whatever the type, one does use both sides of each \ndichotomy, though not with equal ease or liking. A \nuseful analogy is that preferences are like handedness. \nFor the most part, people are either right-handed or \nleft-handed. However, people do use both hands, \nusually reaching first with the preferred hand because \nitis more comfortable and natural to do so. \n\n6. People typically use and develop more ease and effec- \ntiveness with the functions and attitudes they like \nthan with their opposites. However, because this is \nnot always true, one should not assume that having a \npreference ensures using it skillfully or effectively. \n\n7. Type preferences are important for understanding \nhow people assimilate information and make deci- \nsions. They describe processes that will seem familiar \nto respondents. One value of type is that it helps peo- \nple use the information they already know about \nthemselves and others in more organized and practi- \ncal ways. \n\n8. If a reported function, attitude, or whole type does \nnot seem right when MBTI results are provided, \nrespondents can discover and decide for themselves, \nwith help from the interpreter, which preference or \nwhich type more accurately describes them. \n\nExplaining the Four Dichotomies \n\nThe next step is to explain the nature of the two alternatives \nthat are included in each dichotomy. The following is a rec- \nommended procedure for presenting each dichotomy: \n\nl. Define the dichotomy itself by focusing on what it \ndescribes. For example: \"Extraversion and Introver- \nsion deal with how we are energized and how we pre- \nfer to use our energy.\" \n\n2. Define each pole of the dichotomy and give examples \nrelevant to the clients experience or purpose in tak- \ning the Indicator. Using language such as the follow- \ning helps emphasize the important fact that everyone \nuses both poles of a dichotomy at least some of the \ntime: \"When we are extraverting, we are focusing on \nthe outside world of people, the environment, and \naction. When we are introverting, our attention is on \n\nInterpreting Results of the MBTI and Verifying Ivpe 117 \n\nour internal world of ideas, inner experiences, and \nrellection. \n\n3. For cach dichotomy, discuss the ways in which peo- \nple who prefer one pole of a dichotomy dilfer from \nthose who prefer its opposite. For example, \"People \nwho prefer Extraversion are likely to be energized by \nbeing around people and activities. Extraverts thcre- \nlore typically seek out situations that permit them to \nexperience and interact with the outside world. Peo- \nple who prefer Introversion are likely to be most \nenergized when they can spend time alone in reflec- \ntion. [ntroverts therefore typically seek out situations \nthat permit them to do more introverting than \nextraverting.\" \n\nIt is helpful to modify the descriptions of the opposite \npreferences of each dichotomy to accommodate the respon- \ndents type and the time available. Concrete behavioral \nexamples are helpful for bringing the theoretical abstrac- \ntions into everyday experience, especially when explaining \ntype concepts to Sensing types. Visual aids and illustrative \nanecdotes that highlight differences are helpful for all types. \n\nVerifying Type \n\nAny type identification method, including an individuals \nresponses to the Indicator, are subject to the errors in \nunderstanding and interpretation that are associated with \nall self-assessment methods.

Nev- \nertheless, the routine use of several corroborating veriftca- \ntion methods is recommended in order either to provide \nmaximum assurance that the reported type is correct or to \nenable identification of a different, better-fitting type. A \nnumber of such approaches to verification are described in \nthis section. \n\nAn essential first step is to explain each preference in a \nneutral and unbiased manner and give examples of each \npair of opposites that are relevant to the clients interests \nand life circumstances. When done carefully, this provides \nan illustration of type differences and is also a first check on \nthe accuracy of the reported type. After each dichotomy has \nbeen described, clients should be given an opportunity to \nassess how they believe they came out in answering the \nIndicator. This may be accomplished simply by asking \nthem how they think they came outfor example, How \ndo you think you answered on that one?\" An alternative \nfeedback procedure such as that described in Verifying Your \nType Preferences (Kummerow, 1986) may be used. This is \nparticularly helpful when giving feedback to groups, as it \nguides respondents through the initial process. \n\n118  Administration and Interpretation \n\n \n\nThe interpreter may then tell the client which preference \nwas actually reported. (Some respondents may prefer to \nhave their results on the four dichotomies given to them all \nat once after they have heard about all the dichotomies. The \ninterpreter can ask the respondent which procedure is pre- \nferred.) If the clients assessment agrees with reported results, \nthe correctness of the reported preference is tentatively con- \nfirmed. When a characteristic is not confirmed, the prefer- \nence in question should be considered to be in doubt and \nevaluated further. \n\nIn this portion of the feedback process, care should be \ntaken to avoid implying that the client is wrong in her or \nhis assessment or that the reported type holds greater \nweight than the clients self-knowledge. Language such as \n^You answered indicating the opposite preference of thc \ndichotomy, so well have to explore that further\" presents \nthe required neutral stance in these circumstances. \n\nPractitioners can choose from among a number of verifi- \ncation aids, depending on the interpreter level of experi- \nence with MBTI interpretation and the needs of the client or \nclient group. The material that follows describes each of \nthese aids. \n\nBrief Descriptions of Each Type \n\nOne way of checking the reported type is through the use of \nthe table Characteristics Frequently Associated with Each \nType\" on the back of the template scoring profile sheet and \nalso included in [ntroduction to Type, which is discussed \nbelow. This table contains short type sketches. People often \nfind it easier to recognize themselves among these minia- \nture portraits than to recognize their preferences one at a \ntime. The booklet Profile of Your MBTI Results (Lawrence &amp; \nMartin, 1996) describes each of the 16 types using a bul- \nleted list of characteristics. Some of the brief descriptions \ncontained in the Introduction to Type booklets that are \ndesigned for specifie groups can also be helpful. These are \nlisted in the next section. \n\nWhen using the brief type tables for verification, the \nindividual should first read the type description that corre- \nsponds to the reported type and then compare this with \nneighboring type descriptions. Should another type descrip- \ntion seem to fit the client as well or better, that type should be \nrespectfully included for consideration as the individual's \nbest-fit type. \n\nUsing Introduction to Type \n\nIf people who take the MBT] inventory are to make real use \nof the results, they need more information than is in the \nreport form and more than they can remember from a ver- \nbal explanation. Io meet this need, Introduction to Type was \nwritten to be used as an interpretation and verification tool. \nWhen MBTI results are provided to individuals or groups, \nthe task is made simpler if people can further verify their \ninitial assessment of their type by reading one or more of \n\nthe full type descriptions in Introduction to Type. By allowing \nthem to see the type contrasts, this booklet helps respon- \ndents put it all together. Further, practitioners generally \nagree that people get the most out of type when they have \naccess to all 16 type descriptions both during and atter veri- \nfication of their type. It is recommended that all individuals \nand group members be given a personal copy of Introduction \nto Type or an alternative set of descriptions of all 16 types. \n\nFor maximum and continuing type understanding, give each \n\nclient a full set of type descriptions. \n\nSince the original Introduction to Type was written by Isabel \nBriggs Myers in 1962, it has undergone several revisions.

In \naddition, versions of the information contained in the booklet \nare available to address the additional interests of particular \ngroups. These include Introduction to Tvpe Dynamics and \nDevelopment (Myers &amp; Kirby, 1994), Introduction to Type and \nCareers (Hammer, 1993), Introduction to Type and Teams \n(Hirsh, 1998), Introduction to Type in Organizations (Hirsh &amp; \nKummerow, 1998), Using Type in Selling (Brock, 1994), and \nIntroduction to Type in College (DiTiberio &amp; Hammer, 1993). \n\nIntroduction to Type provides additional information that \nean be useful in helping a client verify his or her type. The \nfollowing areas are covered: \n\nThe mutual usefulness of opposite types \n\nThe effects of preferences in work situations \n\nThe effects of different pairings of thc preferences \nType and career choice \n\nType and problem solving \n\nType and relationships \n\nThe full-page type descriptions in Introduction to Type are \nincluded in Chapter 4+. Each describes one type at its best, \ngives the characteristics of people of that type, describes \nhow others see people of this type, and discusses potential \nareas for growth within the type. All 16 describe type as \nexemplified by normal, well-balanced, effective people. In \ntheoretical terms, the descriptions assume adequate devel- \nopment of two processes, the dominant and the auxiliary. \nHowever, the section of the type description that discusses \npotential areas for growth includes information about the \npossible effects of lack of development of the auxiliary \nfunction and the dominant function, as well as a brief \ndescription of the natural consequences of devoting less \nenergy to the tertiary and inferior functions. \n\nThe facing pages in all versions of Introduction to Type give \na description of a pair of types with the same dominant \nprocess. The pair differ only in their auxiliary process. For \nexample, for the two extraverted Thinking types, the descrip- \ntions on the facing pages are EST] and ENTJ; both are \nextraverted Thinking types, but EST] has introverted Sensing \nas the auxiliary process, and ENT] has introverted Intuition \n\nas the auxiliary. Similarly, ISEP and INFP appear on facing \npages. Both have introverted Feeling as their dominant func- \ntion, but for ISFP, extraverted Sensing is the auxiliary; and \nlor INFP the auxiliary function is extraverted Intuition. \n\nDevelopment of the Type Descriptions \n\nThe sixth edition of Introduction to Type (ITT) is a revision of \nthe 1993 (fifth) edition, by Linda K. Kirby and Katharine D. \nMyers. The original (1962) type descriptions, written by \nIsabel Myers, were firmly grounded in Jungs theory of psy- \nchological types, as developed and expanded by Myers and \nBriggs. Longtime users of the MBTI are aware of major differ- \nences in the style, format, and content of the fifth edition as \ncompared to previous versions of the booklet. In developing \nthe type descriptions in this edition, Kirby and Myers pre- \nserved the solid theoretical basis provided by Myers. In addi- \ntion, they capitalized on a wealth of information from their \nown and others research, many years of practitioner observa- \ntions, and the knowledge of people who had expertise about \ntheir own and others types. The revised type descriptions are \nbased on the following resources and procedures: \n\nB Myers original type descriptions, as well as descriptions \npublished in five different popular works, were reviewed. \nStatements describing each type were extracted and com- \npiled by type into a questionnaire. \n\nM The questionnaire was administered to groups of five or \nsix people of each type, each of whom had taken the \nMBTI, received feedback, verified their type, and indi- \ncated confidence about their best-fit typebut who had \nlittle additional experience using type. About 120 people \ncompleted the questionnaire. \n\nB The questionnaire was also sent to about 30 type \nexpertspeople who were very experienced and knowl- \nedgeable about type in general and about their own type \nas well. \n\nB The results from both general respondents and type \nexperts were combined with ratings of descriptors used \nin several research studies conducted by McCarley and \nCarskadon (1986) and Ruhl and Rodgers (1992). All of \nthese data were compiled to identily descriptors that \nwere ranked very high, high, moderate, and low. \n\n8 The highest-ranked descriptors were used in the ITT \ndescriptions. \n\nB Persons of each type were consulted to ensure that the \nfinal descriptors acccurately reflected the characteristics \nthat each type considered to be most important as well as \naccurate. \n\ns (4 \n\nThese carefully developed type descriptions are further \nenhanced by the consistency and logic of their presentation. \nThe type descriptions include the type at its best, as charae- \nterized by the dominant function and attitude and auxiliary",

Each \ndescription concludes with a picture of how eaeh type \nappears in exaggerated form, when there is inadequate \naccess to the tertiary and inferior funetions, and when a \nperson of that type is in the grip of the inferior function. \n\nExplaining Type Dynamics \nand Development \n\nAn explanation of the dynamic nature of type theory and \nthe MBTI is typically reserved for a later discussion of \ntype, depending on the time available and the particular \napplication involved. However, if the interpreter will not \nhave a later opportunity to explain type dynamics and \ndevelopment to an individual or group, it is essential that \na general explanation of this area be included in the inter- \npretation session. When such a procedure is not included, \nrespondents can easily dismiss their MBTI results as noth- \ning but static and rigid categories or boxes. Such a mis- \nunderstanding will limit a respondents ability to make \npractical and effective use of the type information pro- \nvided. At a minimum, therefore, when the interpreter has \nonly a single opportunity to explain the MBTI, the follow- \ning aspects of dynamics and development should be cov- \nered, at least briefly: \n\nB A four-letter type reflects a dynamic and developmental \nsystem lor describing personality. Each type typically uses \nthe favorite forms of Perceiving and Judging in specific \nways but is also free to use the less-preferred processes as \nwell. A persons type does not change over time; however, \npeople may express their type in somewhat different ways \nat different times and at different ages and stages of life. \nOne consequence of this is that some people may answer \nthe MBTI questions differently at different life stages. \n\nB Each type has a dominant, or leading, function and tends \nto use it in the preferred attitude of Extraversion or Intro- \nversion. Fach type also has an auxiliary, balancing func- \ntion that tends to be used in the less-preferred attitude of \nExtraversion or Introversion. The title of each type in \nIntroduction to Typc identifies the dominant and auxiliary \nfunctions. For example, the title for EST] is Extraverted \nThinking with Introverted Sensing. This indicates that for \nESTJ types, extraverted Thinking is the dominant function \nand introverted Sensing is the auxiliary function. The title \nfor INTP is Introverted Thinking with Extraverted Intuition, \nspecifying introverted Thinking as the dominant function \nand extraverted Intuition as the auxiliary function. \n\nB The function that is the polar opposite of the dominant \nfunction, called the inferior function, tends to be the least \ndeveloped, least experienced, and least comfortable part \nol ones type. For example, the inferior function for EST], \nwhose dominant function is extraverted Thinking, is \n\n120 Administration and Interpretation \n\nintroverted Feeling, the polar opposite of extraverted \nThinking. \n\nW The polar opposite of the auxiliary function is called the \ntertiary function. It tends to be somewhat more accessible \nand comfortable than the inferior function. \n\nB The dynamics of type, as identified by the dominant, aux- \niliary, tertiary, and inferior functions, describe the individ- \nuality and richness of personality in ways that people can \neasily recognize and understand. These dynamics are \nembodied in the type descriptions in Introduction to Type. \n\nIn addition to covering these basic points, respondents \ncan be directed to the booklet Introduetion to Type Dynamics \nand Development (Myers &amp; Kirby, 199+), which presents the \ndynamic information in a practical and accessible way. \n\nFactors That Influence \nAccuracy of Self-Report \n\nEach stage of the interpretive process gives information \nthat the respondent can consider and use in evaluating the \naccuracy of his or her type. In some cases, there is instant \nrecognition of the correctness of the results. For these peo- \nple, most of the time spent on interpretation will be used in \npresenting type examples and practical applications. Other \nindividuals have doubts about their type, and the steps \ndescribed above are designed to bring out new information \nthat may help resolve questions about which is their best- \nfit type. \n\nThroughout the explanation process, the interpreter \nshould keep in mind possible reasons why the MBTI results \nmay not be an accurate estimate of that persons type. The \nworking assumption of type theory is that each person has \ninnate, or true, preferences. It is important to be aware of \nreasons why type preferences may be incorrectly reported. \nThese include the following: \n\nB There may be a lack of differentiation of type. Such a \nlack occurs more often in young people whose develop- \nment into a type may still be in the stage of exploration",

An adolescent who is trying to \n\"fit in\" may therefore answer the Indicator as an Ex- \ntraverted type when in fact Introversion is his or her nat- \nural and comfortable preference. \n\nB [here may be difficulty in choosing between the expec- \ntations ol ones parents and ones own preferences. For \ncxample, a Sensing type raised in a family in which the \nparents and siblings preter Intuition may learn to value \nIntuitive qualities over Sensing qualities, attempt to \ndevelop those qualities, and therefore answer as an Intu- \nitive type on the Indicator. \n\nW The respondent may feel torn between demands of work \nand his or her own preferences. This source of bias can \nbe greatly minimized through giving careful instructions \nto respondents when the MBTI is administered. \n\nB The respondent may be in a life crisis and may not be \nusing his or her typical mode of coping. Giving the Indi- \ncator when the client is experiencing unusual distress is \ngenerally not recommended. \n\nAa The MBTI may have been administered in a situation \n\ninvolving authority (e.g., for employment); sometimes \nrespondents answer questions in terms of their percep- \ntion of that authority's preferences instead of their own. \n\nB [he words used to explain the MBTI may have been mis- \nunderstood, and the respondent may have rejected the \nterms because of an assumed negative connotation, as \nwhen Introversion is interpreted to imply neurotie or shy, \nwhen Judging is interpreted to mean judgmental, or when \nFeeling is interpreted to mean overemotional. When ex- \nplaining the MBTI, you may need to repeat a discussion of \nthe meanings of thesc terms in the context of the MBTI. \n\nB The individual may have been influenced by perceived \nsocial pressures. Such an effect is most likely to occur with \nthe T-F dichotomy if the respondent equates Thinking \nwith masculinity and Feeling with femininity. \n\nB The respondent may have believed that the type descrip- \ntion must fit his or her own characteristics perfectly to be \naccepted. Carefully explaining, before providing MBTI \nresults, that there are a variety of individual differences \nwithin any particular type should minimize this effect. \n\nB The respondent may be in a growth period in which pre- \nviously unused or unappreciated processes are being \ndeveloped. During such a period, there may be uncer- \ntainty about previously trusted processes as the less \ndeveloped processes become differentiated. For exam- \nple, during midlife a dominant Feeling type may become \nfascinated with logically analyzing life problems and cor- \nrespondingly be less interested in solving problems by \nmaintaining harmony. \n\nAll self-report instruments are subject to the kinds of \neffects described above and to many other effects not \nintended by those who administer them. Since the MBTI \ndichotomizes responses, and since the theory postulates \n\"true preferences,\" the MBTI interpreter should be particu- \nlarly careful during each stage of the interpretation to help \nindividuals discover for themselves which pole of cach \ndichotomy best fits them. \n\nIt is not necessary for the respondent to discover true \npreferences\" during the introductory session, but it is neces- \nsary for the interpreter to set the stage for the search. A key \ntool during interpretation is the full-page type description. \nAny qualms or demurs should be taken seriously. With \nexperience, an interpreter can judge which of the above \nsteps are necessary for a particular client and which may be \nomitted; however, the issues and strategies discussed above \nshould be kept in mind during any interpretation. \n\nInterpreting the Preference Clarity \nIndex and Preference Clarity \nCategories on the MBTI \n\nQuantitative interpretation of MBTI results as an indication \nthat a respondent has more or less of a preference is \nincorrect. Such a practice is the most pervasive source of \nmisunderstanding and misinterpretation of the MBTI. Un- \nlike numerical scores on trait instruments that are designed \nto reflect an amount of the trait being measured, the \nMBTI preferenee clarity index (pci) is designed to show \nonly how sure the respondent is that she or he prefers onc \npole of the dichotomy over its opposite. For forms that pre- \nceded the current Form M of the Indicator, the term prefer- \ncnce score was used rather than preference clarity index. See \nChapter 7 for the rationale for the change in designation \nand for the details of this index. The number associated \nwith an MBTI preference, whether it is the previous prefer- \nence score or the current preference clarity index, is most \nappropriately interpreted as providing information about \nthe likelihood that the preference has been correctly re- \nported. Any questions concerning a preference clarity index \nshould focus on this meaning and be used for joint explo-",

The meanings of \nthese categories are discussed on the next page, but first \nsome cautions are in order. \n\nThe preference clarity index is an estimate of relative confi- \ndence that a preference has been accurately identified. Any \nother quantitative interpretation of MBTI results is incorrect \nand leads to misunderstanding and misinterpretation. \n\nClarity Does Not Imply Excellence \nor Type Development \n\nThe most frequent error that oecurs regarding the numeri- \ncal portion of MBTI results is assuming that clarity of pref- \nerence implies excellence; it is incorrect to assume that a \nperson with a preference clarity index of N 30 has a better \ncommand of Intuition than a person with N 15. A larger \nnumber simply means that the respondent, when forced to \nchoose, is more clear about what he or she prefers. While it \nfrequently happens (and it is reasonable to expect) that \nthose who report clear preferences (a) exercise them more \nand thus (b) are more likely to have developed the skills \nassociated with those preferences and, further, that they (c) \nare more likely to develop the traits and habits associated \nwith exercise of those skills, this sequence may have been \ninterrupted in any given individual. For example, a person \nmay answer the Indicator to reflect a very clear preference \n\nInterpreting Results of the MBTI and Verifying Type  121 \n\nfor Thinking as a way of making decisions. However, for \nunknown reasons, his or her actual decision making may \nvacillate unpredictably and inappropriately between Think- \ning and Feeling, perhaps resulting in generally poor decision \nmaking. Another person with the same very clear preference \nfor Thinking may use this preferred process to make gener- \nally consistent and satisfying decisions. The preferenee clar- \nity index lor each of these individuals by itself does not \npermit us to determine each individuals inadequacy or \nexcellence in using the Thinking function. \n\nFor the same reasons cited regarding \"excellence,\" pref- \nerence clarity does not imply such concepts as degree of \ntype development, or how differentiated a person is, or \nhow well or poorly he or she will perform any given task or \nsucceed or lail in any occupational setting. The use of pref- \nerence clarity indexes to make such inferences is inappro- \npriate, misleading, and damaging. \n\nUse of the MBTI Step II to Clarify Preferences \n\nThe meaning of more and less clear preferences on all the \nMBTI dichotomies must be interpreted with caution, espe- \ncially in light of the information available regarding the \ncomponents or subscales that contribute meaning to each \ndichotomy. These components are elicited through the scor- \ning of Form K of the MBTI, which yields the Step H \nExpanded Interpretive Report (EIR) mentioned in Chapter \n5. The subscales associated with each MBTI dichotomy do \nnot neeessarily identify all the possible components of the \nunderlying type construet, nor are such known and poten- \ntial components equivalent to the complexity and breadth \nof Jungs constructs. Rather, each dichotomy not only is \nhypothesized to be greater than the sum of its identified parts \nbut also is assumed to be influeneed by each of the other \ndichotomies and their particular combination. However, \nobserved patterns of subscale scores within each dichotomy \ncan provide useful information about the clarity of a respon- \ndents preference for one or the other pole of a dichotomy. \nFor example, it is fairly common for respondents to have one \nor two subscale seores associated with the domain opposite \nto that of the underlying preference. Thus a person may have \nan underlying preference for Sensing, yet her Step I] pattern \nof subscales may show her to be habitually using one or \nmore components of Intuition. Such an individual may \nanswer enough items in the Intuitive direction that a low \npreference clarity index for Sensing may result. \n\nA detailed description of the Step II EIR subscales and \ntheir relationship to type preferences is beyond the scope of \nthis manual. A complete description of this scoring system \nwill be available in Manual for the Step H Expanded Interpic- \ntive Report, which is in press. In interpreting MBTI results, \nhowever, it is important to bear in mind that there are sev- \neral alternative explanations for varying preference clarity \nindexes. An important possibility is a pattern of using spe- \ncife components of an underlying prelerence in a manner \n\n122 Administration and Interpretation \n\n \n\nthat affects ones preference clarity on a dichotomy.

They provide information \nregarding the confidence one may have that a respondent \nholds the preference he or she has reported on each \ndichotomy of the Indicator. \n\nVery Clear Preferences (pci 26-30) Respondents who \nreport very clear preferences (roughly a pci of 26 or more) \nusually agree that they hold the preferences reported by \nthe MBTI and often most of the characteristics \nthat accompany those preferences. It can be useful to \ninquire during the interpretation session about how the \nperson uses the less-preferred function or attitude when \nthe situation demands it. For example, one might discuss \nhow a respondent who reports a very clear preference for \nP meets required deadlines. Do not be surprised to find \nsome respondents who are always on time despite their \nclear preference for Perceiving. \n\nClear Preferences (pci 16-25) When an individuals pci is \n16 through 25, there is a reasonable probability that the \nrespondent holds and acts on the reported preference and \nmany of the attitudes and skills that accompany it. \n\nModerate Preferences (pci 615) With a preference \nclarity index of 6 through 15, the respondent may still most \noften agree with the description of the reported preference, \nbut the interpreter should inquire whether the inter- \npretation fits and should be alert for questions about pre- \nference during the explanation. It is quite likely that such \nan individual makes habitual use of one or more aspects of \nthe opposite pole of the dichotomy and may spontaneously \ndescribe such use. \n\nSlight Preferences (pci 15) When the prefcrence clarity \nindex is 1 through 5, a change of one or two questions could \nchange the letter designation. The respondent has cs- \nsentially split the vote.\" The interpreter should carefully \ninquire about whether the reported preference is correct for \nthe person. The interpretation and verification methods \ndescribed earlier in the chapter will prove helpful here. For \nsome people, less clear preferences reflect discomfort and \ndissatisfaction in using both domains of a dichotomy. For \nexample, a slight T-F preference may be associated with a \nreport of trouble in knowing whether to follow my head or \nmy heart. In many cases, however, such a result may be \naffected by the consistent and comfortable exercise of \n\nTable 6.2 Percentage of Respondents on \nForm M at Each Level of Preference \n\nPreference \n\nClarity E-I S-N T-F J-P \nSlight 23 21 28 22 \nModerate 43 42 42 37 \nClear 25 28 21 26 \nVery Clear 9 9 9 14 \n\nNote: N = 3,036.

For example, it is not uncom- \nmon for a person who prefers Feeling to also reveal a \nquestioning approach in decision making (a component of \nThinking) rather than an accommodating approach (the \nopposite component of Feeling). Nevertheless, that person \nstill has an underlying preference for the Feeling pole of the \nThinking-Feeling dichotomy. \n\nSocial demands can also provide different pressures for \nmen and women on the T-F dichotomy. Men are encour- \nagcd more toward Thinking activities and women toward \nFeeling activities. In daia reported for Form G in the 1985 \nManual, one-fifth to one-fourth of males and females \nshowed slight preferences for all dichotomies but T-F On \nthe T-F dichotomy, two-fifths of males preferring Feeling \nand females preferring Thinking reported only slight pref- \nerences on T-E In developing Form M, concern for issues \naround the T-F dichotomy led to the elimination of items \nthat produced different responses for men and women. \nItems showing significant gender differences were also \neliminated in Form M for the three other MBTI di- \nchotomies. Because gender effects appear to be most perva- \nsive for T-E it is useful to inquire whether less clarity for \na respondent indicates clear preferences that seem less \nclear to the respondent because he or she answered ina \nsocially expected manner, or whether the lesser clarity \nindicates a conflict between sex role expectations and type \npreferences. \n\nInterpreters and respondents who do not adequately \nunderstand type theory and the MBII will sometimes inter- \npret less clarity as advantageous, interpreting the splitting \nof votes as indicating good command of both domains. \nSuch an interpretation is theoretically unsound in an \napproach that emphasizes the adaptive advantages of spe- \ncialization of mental processes. In addition, there are no \nresearch data available that support a notion that equality \nof preferences is advantageous. \n\nAs shown in Table 6.2, people with clarity indexes in the \nslight category are not uncommon, ranging from 21% on \nthe S-N dichotomy to 28% on the T-F dichotomy.

    "content": "by the poles of the dichotomies, analysis indicates a fairly \neven distribution with the regard to the poles of E-I and T-F \ndichotomies. The percent of people reporting an E prefer- \nence who fall in each prelerence clarity category is about \nequal to those reporting an I preference, and the same is \ntrue for the I-F dichotomy. However, about twice as many \npeople who report a J preference fall into the clear and \nvery clear categories as compared to those who report a P \npreferenee (26.4% versus 13.7%), and about three times as \nmany of those reporting an S preference fall into the very \nclear and clear categories as compared to those report- \ning an N preference (28% versus 9%). Two factors must be \nconsidered in attempting to interpret these results. First, \nthe data are based on the national sample, which included \nmore Sensing and Judging types than Intuitive and Perceiv- \ning types. Second, the intervals included within the four \npei categories are different. The slight and very clear \ncategories have 5 intervals each (1-5 and 26-30, respec- \ntively), while the moderate and clear categories have \n10 intervals each (6-15 and 16-25, respectively). For the \npractitioner, whether the observed differences in the poles \nof S-N and J-P are the result of sampling and/or interval \ninfluences is not a central concern. The practical implica- \ntions of client differences in preference clarity are the \nimportant area for those who interpret the MBTI. Practi- \ntioners who can draw on a wide range ol possible \"expla- \nnations\" that might account for different preference clari- \nties will be best prepared to help respondents identify their \nbest-fit type. \n\nComparative Clarity of Dominant \nand Auxiliary Functions \n\nThe 1985 Manual presented data relevant to the hypothesis \nthat the dominant function will reasonably be expected to \nshow greater clarity of preference than the auxiliary func- \ntion. However, as discussed in Chapter 9, the hypothesis \nitself may not be an appropriate test of type theory. In addi- \ntion, subscale patterns revealed in the MBTI Step II may \nhelp illuminate sources of differences in clarity for both \ndominant and auxiliary functions. \n\nInterpreting Results of the MBTI and Verifying Type 123 \n\nComparison of Phrase Questions \nand VWord-Pair Questions \n\nThe preferences for E-1, S-N, I-E and J-P can be divided \ninto that portion that is obtained from the phrase questions \nand the portion elicited by word pairs. Computer reports of \ntype results typicallv provide a preference clarity index for \nthe total of MBTI responses as well as for the phrase ques- \ntion and word-pair question parts. The statement in the \n1985 Manual that \"there is little research dealing with dif- \nferential responses to Word Pair and Phrase Questions\" \n(Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985, p. 61) continues to be true at \nthis time of manual revision. The single study reviewed at \nthat time (Nechworth &amp; Carskadon, 1979) has not stimu- \nlated additional research on this topic. Inferences about the \npossible meaning of phrase and word-pair discrepancies are \ntherefore discouraged. In fact, the sections of the profile and \nnarrative that reported scores and types for word-pair and \nphrase questions separately are no longer provided in the \nrevised computer profile and report. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe interpreters role is not to determine the accuracy of the \nMBTI personality inventory. The interpreters task is to pro- \nvide ways in which respondents can understand their best \nand most trustworthy way of functioning. While experience \ngenerally shows that clear preferences are likely to be seen as \naccurate, the interpreter should be prepared for the occa- \nsional case in which very clearly reported preferences are the \nresult of the individuals overreaction to doubts about the \nopposite domain, which may actually be the one the individ- \nual prefers. There are also cases in which less clear prefer- \nences are subjectively experienced by respondents as clear \nand consistent. One explanation for this may be the particu- \nlar pattern the individual may show on component parts of \nthe underlying type dichotomy. As with all psychological \ninstruments, the interpreter should keep in mind that self- \nreport from a limited number of questions, no matter how \ncarefully validated, cannot completely describe any human \nbeing. In addition, a small percentage of people may not \nidentily with a psychological type perspective of personality. \nFor these individuals, some other explanatory approach may \nbe more appropriate and meaningful. \n\n P \nbL \neia TM nee CHS B.A \n19 4! one zi [p^ i p 41  r \n( 4 \n. | ' 4 i \n&gt; i  B  \n$ 1 Bd bs \n!) \"y rs i fi \ni qu 6 ` 54 P  \nu j la p \ne \nG in: 3 ie \n: oc } l - d IZ a  \n M P f \nE B eui \"m \n9 6 i \namit NES ,  * \ndba Ae in UE se! ? 1 si \n. \n\" = | ie = , ee 4 e c oe \na Sen T 1.

In establishing the reliability of the MBTI, continu- \nous scores on the four scales are used to produce internal \n\n126 Research \n\nconsistency and test-retest estimates in a manner that is sim- \nilar to that used for trait-based instruments. However, the \nmost important aspect ol reliability for the MBTI is the con- \nsistency of categorical resultswhether the respondent is \nthe same type on retest and whether the respondent shows \nconsistent results on different parts of the instrument. Chap- \nter 8 presents reliability evidence from both perspectives. As \nyou read Chapter 8, you will become aware of the following: \n\nB How internal consistency was studied using a logical \nsplit-half^ procedure \n\nB The improvement in reliability of Form M over Form G \n\nB llow type development inlluences reliability results in \nsome samples \n\nB Why test-retest categorical agreement ean never reach \n100% \n\nB The equivalence of some item response theory terms \n10 familiar classical test theory terms \n\nIn Chapter 9, Validity, the emphasis is on research on \ntype dynamics and whole types rather than on individual \ndichotomies, whose validity has been well established. \nEstablishing the validity of each of the dichotomies was a \nnecessary and important aspect of validating the MBTI in \nearlier years. However, an unfortunate consequence of this \nfocus was the interpretation of the MBTI as reflecting four \nindependent traitsa point of view that was familiar to \nresearchers and for which many statistical techniques were \navailable. Some evidence for the validity of the four di- \nchotomies that was included in the 1985 Manual appears in \nsummary form in this chapter, and new data are also pre- \nsented.

As discussed in Chapter 2 of this \nmanual, the construction of Form M followed the same \ngeneral principles as did the construction of the previous \nforms. The goal was to balance the long tradition of the \nIndicator with changes suggested by new psychometric \napproaches. To understand the construction of Form M, \ntherefore, it is important to understand how the previous \nforms of the Indicator were developed. \n\nThe challenges involved in constructing the MBTI derive \nfrom the nature of Car] G. Jungs theory of psychological \ntypes. These challenges are not typical of most psychologi- \ncal measures because the intent of the Indicator is not to \nmeasure people or the traits they are said to have or pos- \nsess, but rather to sort people into groups to which, in the- \nory, they already belong. \n\nAll of the forms described in this chapter, including \nForm M, are designed for Step I of the Indicator, which \ninvolves knowing and understanding a person's type. Step I \nidentifies a person's preference on each of four dichotomous \nscales, E-I, S-N, T-F and J-P. The preferences indicated for \nthese four scales are then combined to yield a four-letter \ntype. As mentioned earlier in this manual, in addition to \nStep I there are two other scoring methods for the MBTI, \ncalled Step Il and Step IIT. Step II yields the four-letter type \nas well as scores on 20 subscales. Step Ill adds scores on an \nadditional seven scales, known as the Comfort-Discomfort \n\n128 Research \n\nscales. Construction of Steps 1l and II are not described in \nthis chapter; the relevant technical material for these steps \ncan be found in their respective manuals (Saunders, 1989, \n1987). \n\nAs outlined briefly in Chapter 2, the construction of the \nMBTI was governed by a working hypothesis: that certain \nvaluable differences in normal people result from their pre- \nferred ways of using perception and judgment. Consonant \nwith Jungs theory, using the MBTI to determine preferences \nrequires that a person choose between two opposites on \neach of the four scales. Each scale included in Step I scoring \nis therefore a dichotomy. The lour separate scales designed \nto determine a respondents preferences represent the fol- \nlowing four dichotomies: \n\nExtraversion or Introversion \nSensing or Intuition \nThinking or Feeling \n\nJudging or Perceiving \n\nThe object of the MBTI is to determine the persons prel- \nerence on each of these four dichotomies so that these results \ncan be reported to the person as a four-letter type. Although \nthe measurement of preferences is currently obtained on \nfour individual scales, the results are meant to be interpreted \nas whole types. The assumption is that the whole is greater \nthan the sum of the parts. The theoretical rationale for this",

The \nevidence supporting this claim is presented throughout this \nmanual, but particularly in Chapter 9. \n\nHistory of the Development \nof Previous MBTI Forms \n\n[his section summarizes the development of the MBTI, up \nto and including Form J of the instrument. Development \nthrough Form J occurred in a series of stages, beginning in \n1942, continuing to the publication of Form G in 1977, and \nthen culminating in the publication of Form J in 1987. The \n1998 revision and the development of Form M will be \ndescribed in later sections. \n\nThe Initial Stage \n\nThe initial questions developed by Isabel Briggs Myers and \nKatharine Briggs to measure Jungs theory were tested first \non a small criterion group of about 20 relatives and friends \nwhose type preferences seemed to the authors to be clearly \nevident from long acquaintance and from a 20-year period \nof careful observation of behavior. This criterion group was \nmade up exclusively of those persons whose preferences \n\nwere clear enough to be manifest consistently in observable \nbehavior. This observation convinced the authors that the \nconstellation of behaviors and attitudes described for each \ntype by Jung could be reliably observed. After an initial \nperiod of identifying behaviors described by Jung, the \nauthors noted additional behaviors and characteristics. \nWhen a behavior scemed to relate to a specific preference, \nT-F for example, the authors studied its appearance, its \nantecedents and effects, and its occurrence in persons \nthought to prefer thinking or feeling. After repeated obser- \nvations and confirmations or disconfirmations of their hy- \npotheses, they became more sure that (1) certain persons \ndid indeed prefer thinking and (2) specific characteristics \nwere found to be associated with thinking and could be \nconsidered derivatives of thinking. Thus, by the time of the \ninitial stages of development of the MBTI, Jungs constructs \nhad been tested and refined by years of observation. \n\nBetween 1942 and 1944 a large number of potential \nMBTI items were written and validated via the initial crite- \nrion group. The authors discussions with respondents also \nrevealed ways to change the items so as to capture the \nessence of the differences between the types. From these \ndiscussions it became clear that the same phrase conveyed \nquite different meanings to different types. \n\nForms A and B \n\nItems that survived the initial validation were collected into \na set of scales called Form A, and a rearrangement of the \nsame items became Form B. The items were tested on pro- \ngressively larger samples. These samples were made up \nmainly of adults because adults were expected to have \nreached higher levels of type development and to therelore \nbe clearer about their preferences and better able to report \nthem. To remain on a scale, any particular item had to be \nanswered by at least 6096 of the people of a given preference \nwith the response that was designed for people of that pref- \nerence. When using this method, a persons preference was \ndetermined by his or her responses to all of the items on \nthat scale. \n\nForm C \n\nAdditional item analysis led to the creation of Form C. One \ncriterion for the inclusion of items in Form C was that a \nquestion having a high validity for one dichotomy was \nexcluded if it also had a high validity for another dichotomy. \nFor example, an item would be excluded if it correlated well \nwith both the E-1 and S-N dichotomies. It was necessary \nto keep the scales as uncorrelated as possible because other- \nwise a strong preference for a scale would distort the evi- \ndence for another scale. The Form C items were intercorre- \nlated first on 248 adult men and later on 214 adult men. The \nfirst intercorrelation had a range of -.17 (E-l x T-F) to .18 \n(E-I x S-N) with a mean of .1 1. The second intercorrelation \n\nhad a range of .14 (E-I x T-F) to .19 (E-I x S-N) with a \nmean of .09. \n\nInternal consistency analyses of Forms A and B had \nmade it clear that responses differed in popularity. To allow \nfor unequal popularity and for omissions, responses to \nitems on Form C were weighted. A prediction ratio (see \nbelow) was substituted for previous item-test consistency \nanalvses. PRU MED. ARTI that the re- \nE d at all, would be given in \n\na: rea limit to retain an item was \na xm ratio of .60. Form C consisted of items from \nForms A and B that survived this analysis, plus one new \nitem and six reworded items. \n\nIn 1947 a Form C3 was developed that incorporated \nitem weighting that allowed better differentiation of indi- \nviduals scoring near 0. Items were weighted as a function of \nthe prediction ratio for the item. The prediction ratio shows \nthe probability that any response is given in accord with \ntotal scale score (ie., the probability that a response \ndesigned for Js is given by Judging types and not given by \nPerceiving types).

At this stage the weights were 0 for \nPR less than .60, I for PR .60 to .69, and 2 for PR .70 or \ngreater. \n\nForm D \n\nThe years 1956 to 1958 constituted a second major period \nof development, in preparation for the 1962 publication of \nthe MBTI as a research instrument by Educational Testing \nService. Over 200 new items, including word-pair ques- \ntions, were submitted to a small group of people of known \ntype who were familiar with the Indicator. Items that sur- \nvived this analysis were submitted to 120 men and women \nwho had taken Form C. The more promising items remain- \ning after item analysis (about 130) were appended to Form \nC to create an experimental Form D. \n\nWhen items were evaluated by the small group of people \nof known type, it was found that some people were more \nable than others to recognize their own general tendencies. \nIf you ask Introverts, Under such and such conditions, do \nyou tend to do (A) or (B)? they are likely to single out the \n\nConstruction and Properties of the MBTI 129 \n\nkey word in (A) and the key word in (B), weigh them \nagainst each other, and decide which reaction is most like \nthem, in accord with how the questions were designed to be \nanswered. On the other hand, Extraverts respond to this \nquestion by harking back to the last time they were in a \nsimilar situation and remembering how they behaved. The \nExtraverts' answer thus reflects behavior on a single occa- \nsion surrounded by extraneous contextual factors. \n\nWhile writing items for Form D, the authors realized \nthat the way to get respondents to concentrate on key \nwords was to give them the key words and nothing else, \nwhich formed the word pairs. For example, here are three \nword pairs: \n\nbuild A B invent \nbenefits A B blessings \nimpulse A. B decision \n\nThe response to the word pairs indicated that while a \nnumber of them had low face-validity, they worked ex- \ntremely well in separating people into the correct cate- \ngories. Word pairs also have a number of other advantages \nover other types of questions, including the following: \n\nB Less distracting \n\nB Less subject to varied interpretation, personal reticence, \nand conscious or unconscious censorship \n\nB More quickly read and answered, making it possible to \nhave more items without increasing the administration \ntime \n\nThe addition of word pairs almost doubled the number ol \nvalid items in Form D. \n\nPrior to the 1956-58 development, all analyses were \nbased on administration of the questions to adults. A series \nof younger-age samplings were then conducted. Younger \nindividuals were presumably less advanced in type develop- \nment and less clear about their preferences. Each sampling \nwas evaluated to determine the extent to which items \nbecame less efficient as samples became younger. \n\nAn internal consistency analysis was done with 385 \ngraduate students. As a result, the lower limit of the predic- \ntion ratio required for retention of an item was raised from \n.60 to .63. New items meeting this criterion were added, \nand weaker items were dropped. \n\nAn analysis with undergraduate students showed only \nslightly lower prediction ratios. The wording of a number of \nthe older items was simplified and used in Forms DO and DI \nwith three high school samples. When the simpler wording \nproduced prediction ratios above .63, the revised wordings \nwere adopted in the final experimental form, D2. Reworded \nitems not meeting this criterion were dropped; or, in a few \ncases, an item was returned to its earlier wording. \n\nIn 1957 a large internal consistency analysis of Form D \nwas conducted using a sample of 2,573 Pennsylvania 11th- \nand 12th-grade males in college preparatory courses and a \nsimilar sample of females. In order to prevent a bias in favor \n\n130 Research \n\nof any particular type, a sample of 200 males and 200 \nfemales of each type was drawn from this population. \nBecause people of different types differ in their liking for \nitems predictive of their preferences, it was important that \nweights assigned for types occurring less frequently in the \npopulation not be influenced by weightings derived from \nmore frequent types. For types with sufficient numbers, a \nsample was drawn equally from the upper and the lower half \nof the students class. Priority was given to overachievers and \nunderachievers to diminish the difference in intelligence \nbetween more and less competent students. \n\nItems were evaluated separately by gender and by type.",

Item weights that had been started in Form \nC3 were used in these lorms and made more stringent. For \nthe first time a tie-breaking formula was adopted, and the \npreference scores were used instead of percentages to denote \nthe strength of preferences. Form F was used in the large \nsamples collected in preparation for publication by Educa- \ntional Testing Service in 1962. In the early 1970s Form E \nwas phased out and Form F became the standard form. \n\nForm G \n\nBetween [975 and 1977, almost 20 years after the large- \nscale data collection in preparation for the publication of \nForm E a new standardization of items was carried out. The \nnew analyses seemed appropriate to ensure that cultural \nchanges had not decreased the utility of items and to make \nsome minor modifications that two decades of experience \nhad suggested were desirable. One goal ol the restandard- \nization was to investigate at what age schoolchildren could \nvalidly take the MBTI. \n\nThe new standardization was based on 1,114 males and \n1,11] females in grades 4 through 12 in three public \nschools in Bethesda, Maryland, and in four private schools \nin the suburbs of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The analyses \nalso included a rescoring of a sample of 3,362 University of \nFlorida freshmen tested in 1972 and 1973. A Maryland sub- \nsample of 1,101 11th- and 12th-grade students was compa- \nrable to the sample used for the original Form F item analy- \nses, consisting largely of college preparatory students of \nabove-average sociocconomic status. \n\nTable 7.1 shows the median item-to-scale correlations \nfor five samples for Form G.

Form G eliminated 38 research items \nnot previously scored for type in Form F added one new \nitem, and dropped two items that no longer met the criteria \nfor inclusion. Some items were modified to eliminate ambi- \nguity or awkward alternatives. Items were rearranged so \nthat all the scored items preceded unscored items. The \nrearrangement put the most predictive items at the begin- \nning so that a usable approximation of type could be \nobtained if the first 50 questions were completed. \n\nWhen Form G was introduced, Form F was still avail- \nable, although primarily used as a research form, and the \nweights for Form F items were therefore changed to match \nthose of Form G. Thus, when scored for type, the 1977 \nForm F and Form G were essentially interchangeable. \n\nForm G Self-Scorable \n\nThe MBTI is often used in workshop settings where it is dil- \nficult if not impossible to administer the instrument, collect \nthe answer sheets, and then send them in for computer \nscoring prior to the workshop. Even if the hand-scoring \ntemplates are used, it is time-consuming and often inconve- \nnient to score large numbers of Indicators on-site during a \nworkshop. For these reasons a self-scorable version of \nForm G was devised. \n\nThe first self-scorable form, developed in 1983, was \ncalled the Abbreviated Version (Form AV) of the MBTI. It \ncontained the first 50 items from Form G (which best pre- \ndict to the total scale scores) in a format that permitted \nself-scoring and provided some interpretive information \nfor the client. Form AV did not provide different weights \nfor men and women on the T-F scale. It was recom- \nmended that Form AV be used only for group situations \nwhere time pressures preclude administration and scoring \nof Form G and when maximum type accuracy is less \nimportant. A study reported by Kaiser (1981) suggested \n\nthat these items could act as a \"surrogate\" for the full set of \nForm G items. Initial studies of Form AV confirmed this \nfinding and suggested that Form AV was a reasonable short \nform lor Form G. However, a number of later studies of",

This form used all 94 of the \nscored items from the standard Form G. Since it contains \nexactly the same items and is scored using exactly the same \nweights as are used to arrive at the four-letter type on the \nstandard Form G, the results from the two instruments are \nthe same. The Form G sell-scorable and the standard Form \nG have the same reliability and validity, since they use the \nsame items and scoring weights. \n\nStep Il and Step Ill \n\nIn 1987 an advanced scoring system was developed for the \nMBTI. An early version of this scoring system was devel- \noped decades earlier by Isabel Briggs Myers in collaboration \nwith Mary H. McCaulley but was never published. Myers \noriginal work was expanded upon and published as the \nType Differentiation Indicator (Saunders, 1987). A new form \nof the MBTI was created at this time, Form J, which con- \ntained all 290 items written by Myers that had survived her \nprevious item analyses. When Form J is scored using this \nnew system, now called Step III, it yields 20 subscales (5 \nunder each of the four dichotomous preference scales) plus \n7 scales called Comfort-Discomfort scales. \n\nThis was followed in 1989 by a scoring system that pro- \nduced only the 20 subscales and not the more clinically rele- \nvant Comfort-Discomfort scales. This system was originally \npublished as the Expanded Analysis Report (Saunders, \n1989). A new form was created at this time, Form K, con- \ntaining 131 items that were needed to score for type as well \nas for the 20 subscales and a number of research items. This \nscoring system is now called Step II. \n\nIssues in the Construction \nof Previous MBTI Forms \n\nDuring the development of MBTI forms through Form G, a \nnumber of problems were confronted that have implica- \ntions for understanding the nature of the instrument. These \ninclude social desirability, weighting for gender differences, \nlocating the midpoint of the scales, and breaking ties. Some \nol these problems, like the issue of social desirability, are \nshared by most psychological and educational tests. Others, \nsuch as how to determine the true midpoint of the scales, \nare unique to the MBTI because of its typological nature. \nAlthough these problems are generally handled differently \n\nConstruction and Properties ofthe MBT]? 131 \n\non Form M, they are documented here for users of Form G \nand because they provide a check on important issues that \nneed to be faced in future development of the instrument. \n\nSocial Desirability \n\nAlf test developers must face the fact that people respond to \nsome items in certain ways not because those responses \nreflect whatever psychological characteristic the item has \nbeen designed to tap but rather because those responses are \nmore popular or socially desirable in the culture. To the \nextent that this happens, the item becomes more a measure \nof social desirability than a measure of the characteristic of \ninterest. \n\nBeginning with the development of Form C, the predic- \ntion ratio formula described earlier in this chapter was used \nto control for the social desirability of each item response \non the MBTI. The prediction ratio gives the goodness of \nthe response, that is, the relationship of the item to all the \nitems for that preference. In order for a response to a ques- \ntion to appear on the scoring keys, the prediction ratio must \nbe .63 or above for a weight of 1, or .72 for a weight of 2, \nand the item popularity for the opposite preference (i.e., the \npercentage of individuals with the opposite preference giv- \ning that response) must be below .50. In this manner the \nformula takes social desirability into account. \n\nThe denominator of the formula gives a measure of the \npopularity of the response. If the second term in the \ndenominator of the formula goes above .50, the response \nhas been given by more than half of those for whom that \nchoice was not intended; thus it is overpopular (i.e., more \nsociallv desirable) and is likely to do more harm than it is \nworth by displacing people at the center of the scale. A \nresponse rejected by the above criteria would be given a 0 \nweight. Some responses with 0 weight were retained in vari- \nous forms of the Indicator to provide counters to weighted \nresponses, for other purposes such as their utility on a spe- \ncial scale, or for future use in case the social desirability of \nthe items changes. \n\nFor about one-third of the scored questions on Forms F \nand G, prediction ratios were similar for both responses, \nand both responses were given the same weight. [In another \nthird of the questions, the responses differed somewhat in \npopularity; in these items, one response was weighted I and \nthe other 2, based on the prediction ratio.

In the first \nitem analysis of 114 males and 110 females (all adults, \nmostly college graduates), it was discovered that some \nquestions were valid only for one gender. The second item \nanalysis also found gender differences in item validity. In \ndeveloping Form C, only items that were valid for both gen- \nders were retained. \n\nIn the early forms separate keys lor males and females \nwere used for E-I, S-N, T-E and J-P. Beginning with Forms \nE and F the same keys were used for both genders because \nitem analyses showed that lor both genders item popularity \nand prediction ratios were comparable on E-1, S-N, and J-P. \n\nOn the T-F scale it was evident that females, even those \nwho in their behavior and attitudes indicated a clear prefer- \nence for Thinking, had a greater tendency to give certain \nFeeling responses than did males. The difference was \nascribed either to the possibility that certain Feeling \nresponses were more socially desirable for females than for \nmales, or to the effect of social training. Separate weights \nwere assigned to T-F items for each sex, based on the pre- \ndiction ratios for each item, with checks that the criterion \ngroups were assigned the correct preference. \n\nNumerous studies in the late 1950s and early 1960s con- \nfirmed the weightings and the division point on TF, which \ntended to produce, among unselected groups of males, a \ndistribution of about 60% T and 40% E The females distri- \nbutions were about one-third T and two-thirds E From the \nmid-1960s to the mid-1970s the distributions on the T-F \nscale showed large changes, while the distributions of the \nother scales remained stable. A 1972 study of University of \nFlorida freshmen produced only 44% T among males and \n30% among females. Almost identical distributions were \nobtained with the 1975 high school samples used to \nrestandardize the MBTI. In other words, the incidence of Ts \nhad dropped for both males and females. \n\nOne might conclude that Ts were a vanishing species at \nthe time of the reweighting or that social/cultural changes \nhave altered the popularity of responses in the Thinking- \nFeeling domain. The latter interpretation seems compatible \nwith a number of sociological and psychological commen- \ntaries, which suggested that Feeling responses might be \nmore acceptable or more popular among young Americans \nthan they were 20 years earlier. \n\nIn the restandardization samples for Form G, item-test \ncorrelations and prediction ratios were computed, follow- \ning precisely the same system as in earlier item analyses. No \nchanges were required lor the E-1, S-N, and J-P scales. \nHowever, Feeling response choices had become more popu- \nlar and therefore lost some of their weighting. Thinking \nresponses, some of which were formerly penalized for over- \npopularity, were less popular and therefore gained added \nweight for that response. \n\nWith the restandardized weights used on Form G, the \nhigh school male sample contained 61% T and the female \nsample contained 3096 T. This was comparable to the earlier \ndistributions. A rescoring of the University of Florida sam- \nple yielded 61% T for males and 30% T for females, also \ncomparable to earlier data. \n\nOmissions \n\nOmissions are permitted in the instructions of the Indicator \nin the belief that greater validity is achieved by the elimina- \ntion of doubtful answers. Type can then be indicated by \nitem responses a person is reasonably sure about, uncon- \ntaminated by guessing. In practice there typically are few \nomissions. More than 62% of the respondents in a large \nCenter for Applications of Psychological Type databank \nsample answered all the questions on Form G, and over \n80% had fewer than three omissions. \n\nResearch with other psychological measures has estab- \nlished individual differences in response styles, including \nacquiescence or general willingness to concur. On the MBTI \nthere is no option to say No directly because of the forced- \nchoice format, so a person who is unable or unwilling to con- \ncur can omit an item.

The \ncomputer-scored narratives and profiles for Form G contain \na section showing the number of omitted items per scale. \nInquiry during the interpretation session into the reasons the \nclient omitted specific questions can provide useful verifica- \ntion information. \n\nLocating the Midpoint of the Scales \n\nIn developing an indicator based on Jungs theory two addi- \ntional problems need to be solved. The first problem is \nwhether each dichotomy represents two different kinds of \npeople, each holding to a separate preference. If there are \ntwo kinds of people for each scale, is the division point \nbetween the groups at the point where the two groups can \nbe most clearly separated? \n\nJungs theory hypothesizes preferences for opposite \ninner dispositions that cannot be thwarted without damage \nto the individuals well-being. Accurately sorting people into \nthe correct category on each ol the four dichotomous type \nconstructs is therefore an important goal for the Indicator. \n\nThere is a second problem that must be solved. A self- \nreport instrument that aims to accomplish the identifica- \ntion of Jungian types through questions and their resultant \nscales also has the unique problem of locating the division \npoint, so that the two categories of people are separated \nwith maximum accuracy. \n\nThus there are two strong reasons why the division point \nshould be as sharp and accurate as possible: (1) to identify \n\nConstruction and Properties of the MBTI 133 \n\nthe two different groups with maximum accuracy and (2) \nto use these distinctions to obtain evidence as to whether \nthe preferences are, as postulated by theory, dichotomous. \n\nIn Form A, where all items had equal weight, the divi- \nsion point was the point on a given scale at which half the \nitems were answered for each pole. By definition this point \nwas the boundary between people showing one preference \nand people showing the opposite preference. The only pos- \nsible check was to see whether the people of known type \nwere correctly classified. From that time on, whenever the \nscoring was changed by dropping or adding iteins or by \nassigning double weight or 0 weight to responses, care was \ntaken not to add more overall weight to one pole of the \nscale than to the other, lest the distribution of scores shift. \nUp until the completion of Form C, the people of known \ntype were rescored at each step to make sure that changes \nwould not shift them to the wrong pole. \n\nThroughout the construction of the MBTI assessment \ntool, numerous steps were taken to deal with the issue of \ndichotomies and the division points. These included (1) \npermitting omissions to help avoid the effects of random \nguessing, (2) allowing for omissions in the scoring lormu- \nlas, (3) giving lower weightings lor overpopular items and \nhigher weightings for the more discriminating responses, \nand (4) using inclusive groups rather than extreme groups \nin the item analyses. \n\nAnother technique useful in determining the true mid- \npoint is plotting MBTI preferences against an external depen- \ndent variable. In order to pinpoint true 0, the dependent \nvariable needs to be sensitive to the slightest indication of \na preference, so that at the point where the preference \nreverses, the plotted line will show a discontinuity in level as \nwell as Cor in place of) a disparity in slope. In addition, the \nsample needs to be very large to stabilize the group means \nand to make the discontinuity visible and statistically signifi- \ncant. An example of this technique for identilying the divi- \nsion point is illustrated by the measures taken to correct the \nE-l division point when it became displaced. \n\nRelocating the E-l Division Point \nUsing Grade Point Average \n\nWhen the scoring for Form F was almost completed, the \n0 point on E-1 was found to have shilted toward the \nExtravert pole. The evidence was an unprecedented major- \nity of Introverts when the Pennsylvania High School sam- \nple was rescored with the new weights (see the 1985 Man- \nual, Appendix B, for a description of this sample). To \ncorrect the error, external evidence was needed to find the \ntransition on the dichotomy between the Extraverts and \nthe Introverts. \n\nDuring the development of Form C, the ycars-of- \ncollege variable had shown a satisfactory discontinuity on \nE-l. This suggested that, as theory predicts, a preference \nfor Introversion is related to interest and/or performance \n\nin academics. This was supported by the high percentage \nof Introverts in college populations. It therefore seemed \nreasonable that the intelligence measures for the Pennsyl- \nvania High School sample (5,025 males and 4,516 \nfemales) and the grade point average (standardized within \neach class) for the college preparatory courses (3,303 \nmales and 2,511 females) might exhibit discontinuities \nthat would indicate the location of the E-I division point \n(Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985).",

    "content": "The Pennsylvania High School sample was rescored \nwith the new E-l division point, and the new location was \ntested by plotting IQ scores separately for males and \nfemales. For males the break, slight but evident because of \nthe large size in the sample, came between the first and sec- \nond of the groups with the three linked scores. This was \nthe point where the division point for the E-I scale was \nfinally established. \n\nlt should be noted that the echange in level between E \nand I was very small in all these analyses, only about .25 \nstandard deviations in grade point average and about 2 \npoints in IQ. For such small differences to be visible, sam- \nples of 4,000 to 5,000 are needed. \n\nBreaking lies \n\nIn the early stages of the MBTIS development, equal points \nfor the poles of the same scale were designated by an x; \nthus the type might be designated IxTJ, or ENFx. With \nForm E a tie-breaking formula was adopted, on the sugges- \ntion of Frederick R. Kling of Educational Testing Service. \nThe formula involves finding the difference between the \npoints for each pole, doubling the difference, and then \nadding a point if either 1, N, E or P is the larger pole, or sub- \ntracting a point if cither E, S, T, or J is the larger pole. This \ntie-breaking formula is also used on Form G. \n\nThe logic behind adding a point to the I, N, or P prefer- \nences is that these are the less frequent types in the popu- \nlation. If a person is that close to the preference (zero dif- \nference), there is probably some environmental response \npressure from the majority preference. This pressure can \nresult in answers conforming to the majority and contrary \nto true preferences; thus the persons *true\" type is probably \nl, N, or P. The rationale for tie breaking on the T-F scale \nwas somewhat different. In this culture males more fre- \nquently prefer and are socialized toward T; females more \nfrequently prefer and are socialized toward E On the possi- \nbility that the weighting of the scales might have overcor- \nrected for social desirability, tie scores assigned males to T \nand females to E However, when the new Form F keys were \npublished in 1978, the scoring was simplified by adding one \npoint to the male Thinking key (i.e., all males get one extra \npoint toward Thinking). This procedure provided insurance \nagainst possible overcorrection and allowed the tie-breaking \nformula to be simplified so that for both males and females \none point is subtracted for T and one added for E \n\n134 Research \n\nItem Response Theory \n\nThe construction of Form M of the MBTI was based on the \nsame assumptions and followed the same general principles \nthat guided construction ol the earlier forms ol the Indica- \ntor. The construction of Form M, however, also involved \nchanges in how items were selected, the method used to \nscore lor type, and how the midpoint of the scales was \ndetermined. Before describing how these three primary \nissues were handled in the development of Form M for the \n1998 revision, it is necessary to provide an introduction to \nitem response theory (IRT) because IRT was used to accom- \nplish all three of the major construction tasks. As the name \nimplies, IRT is a theory about how item responses are \nrelated to the underlying construct in the individual that is \npresumed to produce those responses. \n\nItem response theory has gained considerable popularity \nin recent years as a method for developing and evaluating \nassessment instruments. This is partly due to the fact that it \nis useful for constructing and evaluating many different \nkinds of instruments. The most common application has \nbeen in designing tests in traditional \"ability-based\" do- \nmains (e.g., achievement, intelligence, aptitude). IRT ap- \nproaches have also been used in developing tests that do \nnot involve making right versus wrong item responses, \nsuch as personality tests (Waller &amp; Reise, 1989), interest \ninventories, and tests designed to help make classification \ndecisions. Embretson (1996) argues that every psychologist \nshould be familiar with IRT since it is the foundation of the \n\"new rules of measurement. A variety of sources (e.g., \nDrasgow &amp; Hulin, 1990; Hambleton, Swaminathan, &amp; \nRogers, 1991; Hulin, Drasgow, &amp; Parsons, 1983) ean be \nconsulted for a more thorough discussion of IRT techniques \nin general. In this section the focus will be on application of \nIRT to the MBTI. Also see Harvey and Thomas (1996) for a \nsimilar discussion as well as for a comparison of IRT, which \nis based on modern test theory, with classical test theory \n(CTT) methods of scoring and determining the reliability of \nthe MBTI. In CTT the unit of analysis is the test or scale as a \nwhole; in IRT it is the individual item (Drasgow &amp; Hulin, \n1990). \n\nConstruction and evaluation of tests based on IRT, there- \nfore, focus on the relationship between a persons true \nscore\" on the psychological characteristic Cor dimension) in",

For example, how likely is it that \na person with a \"true\" preference for Extraversion will \nchoose the Extraverted response to an item on the E-1 \nscale? \n\nWhile many different IRT models have been proposed, a \nhighly desirable aspect of current IRT models, as opposed \nto CTT models, is that they allow for both linear and nonlin- \ncar relations to exist between the underlying psychological \ncharacteristie and the observed item response. This is \n\nimportant for the MBTI because, as will be demonstrated, a \nnonlinear relationship is both theoretically desirable and \nempirically accurate. The relationship between the response \nand the construct can be graphically described using an item \ncharacteristic curve (ICC). The horizontal axis of an ICC for \na particular item shows the varying levels of the psychologi- \ncal characteristic the item is designed to measurc. The verti- \ncal axis (phr) shows the probability that a person at a given \nlevel would respond to the item in the keyed direction. \n\nThe scores are called theta in IRT terminology and are \ndenoted as 0. Theta corresponds roughly to a nonlinear \nrescaling of the \"true score\" of classical test theory (Dras- \ngow &amp; Hulin, 1990). Figure 7.1 shows two hypothetical \nICCs. In both cases scores on the far left of the scale repre- \nsent people with very clear preferences for Extraversion, \nand scores on the far right of the scale represent people with \nvery clear preferences for Introversion. The right half of the \nscale, Introversion in the case of the MBTI E-I scale, is \ncalled the keyed direction. While choice of which pole of \nthe dichotomy is defined as the keyed direction is entirely \narbitrary for the purposes of IRT, for the sake of consistency \nwith previous MBTI conventions I, N, E and P are defined \nas the keyed direction. So as 6 increases from left to right, \nwe would expect higher levels of endorsement of the item \nin the predicted, or keyed, direction, which is the Intro- \nverted direction. In other words, we would expect that peo- \nple with a elear preference for Introversion would have a \nmuch greater chance of giving the Introverted response to \nan E-l item than would people with a clear preference for \nExtraversion. \n\nThe IRT models that are designed for dichotomously \nscored items, such as those used on the MBTI, describe \neach items characteristics or performance using up to three \nparameters. These parameters define the way in which a \npersons placement on 8 is related to the observed likeli- \nhood of endorsing the item in a given direction (e.g.. a cor- \nrect response in the case ol a right-wrong test item, or a \nresponse in the kcyed direction in the case of a personality or \ninterest inventory item). \n\nThe a parameter describes an item's degree of discrimi- \nnation. Higher discrimination parameters are associated \nwith items that produce more information regarding a per- \nsons standing on the characteristic of interest (denoted by \n0). In Figure 7.1, the item producing the dashed item char- \nacteristic curve has a much higher a parameter than the item \nproducing the solid line. The steeper the curve at the partie- \nular 0 that is most relevant to the purposes of the measure- \nment, the more information is produced and the greater the \nlikelihood of the person responding in the keyed direction \nto the item. The 0 that is most relevant for an MBTI item is \ndescribed in the next section. For a perfectly flat line, a \nwould equal 0, which would indicate no information; for \nsuch an item, no matter what 6 you examined, the likeli- \nhood of responding in the keyed direction would be the \nsame. \n\n135 \n\nConsiruction and Properties of the MBTI \n\nPKR \n\n1.0 GE ME Mi NENE aN MN TEXPrrrrrrlil \n\n0.8 \n\n0.6 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.2 \n\n&amp; \ng \nz \nB \ng \n \n&amp; \nE \ne \n\n00- mm mS OG Oe Se mmm m n m UE Gm S m n un  \n\n-3.0 TAS E20 - x \n\nExtraversion \n\nID 5 0.0 0.5 1.0 125 20 2:5 3.0 \nTheta Introversion \n\nITEM ms | mmm 2 \n\nFigure 7.1 ltem Characteristic Curves for Two Hypothetical Items \n\nThe b, or difficulty, parameter in IRT quantifies the left- \nright location of the ICC on the 0 scale; items that are more \n\"difficult\" will have their ICCs shifted toward the right por- \ntion of the horizontal scale, whereas easier items will be \nshifted toward the left. When applied to either right-wrong \nor inventory-type tests, the main function of the difficulty \nparameter is in telling us the area on the 0 scale at which  \ngiven test item produces the maximum amount of informa- \ntion regarding the persons score on the psychological char- \nacteristic in question: \"Hard\" items provide the most infor- \nmation for people who score toward the right end of the 0 \nscale, whereas easy items provide maximum information \nfor those who score toward the left end of the 0 scale.

For \nexample, imagine moving the dashed line in Figure 7.1 to \nthe right so that the almost vertical portion of the line \nwould be over the 0 at 2.0. This would be an item that pro- \nvided information about people who are, for example, clear \nIntroverts versus those who are very clear Introverts. Such \nan item would provide little information about Introverts \nversus Extraverts because the probability of responding in \nthe keyed direction would be the same for all Extraverts \nand for Introverts whose 8 is less than 2.0. \n\nFinally, the c, or lower asymptote, parameter defines the \nbaseline for item-endorsement rates that would be expected \nfrom individuals who score very far to the left (low) end of \nthe 0 scale. In traditional right-wrong tests, a nonzero lower \nasymptote for the ICC is often attributable to low-ability \nindividuals guessing thc correct answer. In tests that do not \nuse right-wrong items, the need for a nonzero lower asymp- \ntote can also occur due to such factors as the social desirabil- \nity (or lack thereof) of a given item response. In MBTI terms \nan item with a high c parameter would mean that even peo- \nple who are very clear Extraverts have some probability of \nresponding to thc item in the Introverted direction. \n\nOne of the main strengths of using IRT for test develop- \nment and evaluation is that it tends to provide a much \nmore detailed view of item functioning than is possible \nusing traditional methods based on CTT. In particular, \nwhen using the three-parameter IRT model described \nabove, items can be selected from a pool to form a test that \nproduces the maximum amount of test-level information \n(which corresponds roughly to the concept of rcliability in \nCTT) and discrimination in a prespecified region of the 0 \nscale. \n\nFor the MBTI, which employs a cutoff score, items can be \nselected to produce a scale that demonstrates its maximum \ndiscriminating power at, or near, the cutoff point on the scale. \n\n136 Research \n\nApplying IRT to the MBTI \n\nAlthough IRT methods were initially developed in the con- \ntext of ability tests that employed right-wrong items, they \nare equally applicable to other types of tests (such as per- \nsonality inventories) that do not view item responses in a \nright-wrong fashion, especially those instruments for which \nitem responses are dichotomous. As is described in more \ndetail by Harvey and Thomas (1996), IRT development and \nscoring can be readily applied to the MBTI given the fact \nthat each of the four primary MBTI scales is bipolar in \nnature, with cach individual item being scored dichoto- \nmously. To apply IRT to the MBTI, one of the responses for \neach item is designated as the keved response and is associ- \nated with 0 scores toward the right of the scale. In this case \nthe I, N, E and P poles were designated as the keyed \nresponse for the E-1, S-N, T-E and J-P scales, respectively. \nHere, the choice of a keyed pole is arbitrary, serving simply \nto define the direction of the 0 scale for each of the MBTI \ndichotomies. \n\nFor example, the hypothetical item denoted by the solid \nline in Figure 7.1 could be seen as being drawn from the E-1 \nscale (e.g., *easy versus hard to get to know\"); in this case, if \nthe I response were designated as the keyed response, all \nindividuals who chose the response hard to get to know \nwould be scored as endorsing the item, and those who chose \nthe E response (easy to get to know) would be scored as \nnot endorsing the item in the keyed direction. Thus for any \ngiven 0 it is possible to determine the percentage of individ- \nuals having that preference that would be expected to pro- \nduce the I response by examining the location of the ICC \nabove the 0 of interest. Thus in the hypothetical solid item \nin Figure 7.1, in the group of people who share a score of \n+1.0 (i.e., relatively clear Introverts), we would expect that \napproximately two-thirds of them (64926) would endorse this \nhypothetical item in the keyed (D) direction, with the rc- \nmainder selecting the E-keyed response. \n\nIn IRT the 6 scale is arbitrary in nature; by convention it \nis typically expressed as a traditional z score (with 0 defin- \ning the midpoint, scores below the midpoint being nega- \ntive, and those above the midpoint being positive). In the \ncontext of the MBTI, by selecting the I, N, E and P poles as \nthe keyed responses, 0 scores are analogous to continuous \nscores on cach of the four MBTI scales, with positive 0 \nscores defining individuals whose types are 1, N, E, and P. \nand negative 9 scores defining individuals whose type lies \nin the E, S, T, and J direction.

Categorical \nMBTI types can therefore be simply assigned by di- \nchotomizing the @ scores; although as a practical matter \nthe 0 score cutoff that corresponds to the natural dividing \npoint between types docs not necessarily have to fall pre- \ncisely at 0 = 0.0, it docs lie in the middle region of the 0 \n\nscale for each of the four MBTI dimensions. (See the sec- \ntion below about how the midpoint of the scales was in fact \nadjusted.) \n\nTo summarize, although the mechanics of IRT scoring \ndiffer quite a bit from the much simpler methods used in \nCTT, itis a very straightforward matter to apply IRT meth- \nods to score the MBTI: Namely, the IRT 6 scores correspond \ndirectly to the continuous scores that were previously cal- \nculated based on the prediction ratio scoring method. \nThese scores can be dichotomized to produce categorical \ntype values in precisely the same way that the earlier PR- \nbased preferences were dichotomized to assign types. \n\nIt is also interesting to note that although the PR and IRT \nmethods are derived from different kinds of measurement \ntheories, they tend to agree to a large extent on what consti- \ntutes a good MBTI item. Gencrally items whose responses \nwere weighted 2,2 or 1,2 based on the PR method also tend \nto have high discriminatory power, or information (i.c., \nthey have high values of the a parameter, or steep slopes) \nand also tend to have b parameters close to the midpoint of \nthe scale. It is with the other items, those whose responses \nwere not weighted as highly using the PR method, that the \niwo methods tend to disagree the most. A number of these \nlowcr-weighted items therefore were not selected for inclu- \nsion in the revised Indicator. However, cven for items where \nthe agreement is high between the two methods, IRT will \ngenerally yield more precise scores. \n\nModel Selection and Fit \n\nAlthough there are different IRT models available, includ- \ning one-, two-, and three-parameter models, the three- \nparameter logistic [RT model was used to select items for \nthe revised MBTI and in the new MBTI scoring system. \nEach parameter in this model provides useful information \nabout MBTI items. Specifically, the reasons for choosing the \nthree-parameter model are as follows. \n\nFirst, past research that used IRT methods to examine \nthe MBTI (e.g., Harvey &amp; Murry, 1994; Harvey, Murry, &amp; \nMarkham, 1994; Harvey &amp; Thomas, 1996) has shown quite \nclearly that the MBTI items do indeed differ with respect to \ntheir relationship with the underlying preferences. Some \nitems simply carry more information, or discriminating \npower, than do other items. In practical terms this is \nindexed by the slope of the ICC for each item. (It was also \nobserved in the PR method by the differential weights asso- \nciated with the items.) The a parameter provides an index \nof the information provided by each item. \n\nSecond, the b parameter defines the location on the 0 \nscale at which the item provides its maximum information, \nor discrimination, The above research studies also demon- \nstrated that there is considerable variability across MBTI \nitems with respect to the areas of the preference scale at \nwhich they are most informative. For any given MBTI scale \nit is desirable to have the maximum amount of information \n\nConstruction and Properties ofthe MBTI 137 \n\noccur at the midpoint of the scale. To the extent that this \noccurs, and to the extent that the midpoint corresponds to \nthe true dichotomy, then the item will be separating people \ncorrectly into the two preference categories. \n\nFinally, with respect to the c parameter, although past \nIRT research on the MBTI has suggested that most MBTI \nitems do not require a sizable nonzero lower asymptote, a \nfew items do produce ICCs whose lower values do not \napproximate 0. To accommodate these items a c parameter \nis needed. This parameter is useful in accounting for social \ndesirability or any other factor that would lead people of \none preference to have a nonzero likelihood of choosing the \nresponse associated with the opposite preference. \n\nAssumptions Underlying the Model \n\nAll scoring systems make assumptions, and IRT is not \nexempt in this regard. As always, it is important to deter- \nmine, to the extent possible, the degree to which these \nassumptions are plausible, or consistent with the actual \nMBTI item responses they are meant to describe and sum- \nmarize. In the case of IRT scoring, some of the most impor- \ntant assumptions relate to the choice of which IRT model to \nuse. Many of the questions related to model choice were \nalready introduced above: Namely, do the items exhibit dif- \nferential discrimination (the a parameter), does this discrim- \nination occur at different points along the preference scale \n(the b parameter), and are there at least some items with \nappreciably nonzero lower asymptotes (the  parameter)? \nResearch has demonstrated that all of these questions are",

This research (e.g., Harvey, \nMurry, &amp; Markham, 1994), which involved fitting the threc- \nparameter model to MBTI item responses, showed quite \nclearly that considerable variability was present with respect \nto the estimates of the a, b, and c parameters. The assump- \ntion of a three-parameter model is therefore justified. \nAnother assumption of IRT is that the set of items on a \nscale is *unidimensional.\" That is, the item pools for a given \nscale should be dominated by a single underlying factor. \nResearch that examined the dimensionality of the Form F \nitem pools (e.g., Harvey, Murry, &amp; Stamoulis, 1995) demon- \nstrated that this is indeed the case and that these underlying \nfactors are precisely the ones hypothesized by the MBTI \nnamely the four preference scales. Subsequent factor ana- \nlytic studies using the updated Form M item pools have fur- \nther established the generality of these earlier findings. This \nis not to say that each of the four MBTI dimensions cannot \nbe broken down into subcategories. Indeed, the factor analy- \nsis of the MBTI Research Form, from which the Form M \nitems were selected, demonstrated the existence of 19 sub- \nfactors, each of which was related as expected to one of the \nfour preference scales. The existence of such a hierarchical \nrelationship between scales and subscales does not violate \nthe IRT assumption of unidimensionality; MBTI scales are \nboth unidimensional and multifaceted as these are defined \n\nin IRT. This is seen quite clearly in the MBTI Step II and \nStep III scoring systems. \n\nAnother assumption on which IRT is based is that the \nunderlying relationship between the psychological charac- \nteristic being measured and the observahle responses to the \nitems chosen to measure that characteristic is nonlinear. \nOne of the most compelling arguments in favor of the appro- \npriatenessindeed, the necessityof the three-parameter \nIRT view of the MBTI can be found in the results obtained \nusing empirical ICCs. In this approach an ICC is computed \nfor each item, plotting the observed. percentage. of item \nendorsements in the keyed direction (vertical axis) against \nthe total number of items endorsed in the keved direction. \nFigure 7.2 presents an empirically derived ICC for a strongly \ndiscriminating MBTI item; Figure 7.3 presents the empirical \nICC for an item with more modest discrimination and a \nclearly defined nonzero lower asymptote. Because these are \nempirical ICCs, the horizontal axis represents actual Form \nG preference scores rather than 0 scores. \n\nThe results presented in Figure 7.2 make a strong case \nfor the need to use a nonlincar model of the relationship \nbetween the underlying preference and the observed likeli- \nhood of endorsing an item in the keyed direction. There is a \nvery strong s-shaped relationship, with this item providing \na large amount of information in the intermediate range of \nthe preference scale and less information (i.e., flatter slope) \ntoward either end of the scale. \n\nThe most extreme case of a nonlinear function for an \nMBTI-like item would be an ICC that assumed the shape of \na perfect step function centered exactly over the midpoint \nol the scale; this would be a case of maximum information \nand maximum separation between people of opposite pref- \nerences on the scale. The dashed line in Figure 7.1 comes \nvery close to representing such an ideal item. For an E-l \nitem with such an ICC, all of the Introverts would choose \nthe Introverted response and none of the Extraverts would, \nand vice versa. While some items come close to this limit, it \nis neither required nor expected that all items assume this \nform, for two reasons: \n\nFirst, neither Jung nor Myers believed that everyone was \na \"type.\" The fact that even the best of the MBTI items do \nnot conform to the ideal demonstrates the theoretical \nproposition that for various reasons, including develop- \nmental or situational factors, a given person at a given time \nwill have some chance of responding to an item in a direc- \ntion opposite that of his or her preference. \n\nThe second reason why the perfect step function would \nnot be expected is that responses are not equally popular for \nall types holding that preference, a fact that has been demon- \nstrated in many item analyses conducted over the years. For \nexample, not all Sensing types are equally likely to respond in \nthe Sensing direction to a given Sensing question. For these \nreasons, desirable items for MBTI scales would be those that \nshowed the general s-shape or pattern but that varied some- \nwhat from the pure step function. \n\n138 Research \n\nPKR \n1.0 od TE O \n\n0.8 \n\n0.6 \"dn \n\n0.4 \n\nIm FA \na \n0.0 ooopooopooono np o een p \n\n60 50 40 30 20 lO 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 \n\nExtraversion Introversion \n\nE-I Preference Scores \n\nFigure 7.2 Empirical Item Characteristic Curve for an E-I Item with High Discrimination \n\nPKR \n1.0 o ] 0o00 \n\n0.8 : o \n\n0.6 \n\n0.4 \n\n0.2 \n\n0.0",

Having provided a basic introduction \nto IRT, we turn now to how IRT was used to (1) select items \nfor Form M and (2) score those items. \n\nSelection of Items for Form M \n\nThe 1998 revision of the MBTI offered the opportunity to \ninvestigate the possibilities of revising, adding, or deleting \nitems from the instrument. To investigate these possibili- \nties, a systematic process was employed to test and select \nitems that would compose a new form of the Indicator: \nForm M. The five major steps in the item selection process \nwere as follows: \n\nB Step I: Create an initial item pool \n\nW Step 2: Develop item selection criteria \n\nB Step 3: Construct a research form \n\nB Step 4: Administer the research form to a national sample \nWB Step 5: Select the final items for the revised MBTI \n\nStep |: Create an Initial Item Pool \n\nAn initial pool of potential items was created from a number \nof sources. One set of items consisted of all 290 questions \ncontained on Form J of the MBTI. These items comprise all \nof the items that had survived the years of research and item \nanalysis conducted by Isabel Briggs Myers. Myers had never \nintended all of these items to be used on the four dichoto- \nmous preference scales. Some of the items were created lor \nthe purpose of additional scoring methods intended to pro- \nvide subscale scoresand indeed some of these items are \nused in the Step If and Step IH scoring systems. Although not \nall of the Form J items were designed to measure type, all \nwere included in creating an initial item pool to determine \nwhether they could function as measures ol type as well as \nfulfill their original function of providing suhscale scores. \n\nA second set of items, coincidentally also numbering \n290, was added to the initial pool for testing. About 90 of \nthese items were written by two experienced MBII users, \none a clinician and the other a researcher. The other 200 \nitems were created by Thomas (1996b).

These criteria are listed in Table 7.2. The MBTI \nResearch Advisory Board also played a role in developing and \nrehining the criteria and applying them to the item pool.",

They evolved through many discus- \nsions and many experimental versions of the final revised \n\n140 Research \n\nform. Some of the criteria were applied to the initial item \npool as a means of narrowing this pool to a more manageable \nsize. Other criteria then became more important as a means \nol selecting the final set of items. \n\nAs seen in Tabie 7.2, the item selection criteria can be \ngrouped into two broad categories: theoretical criteria and \nempirical criteria. \n\nTheoretical Criteria Theorctical criteria were primarily \nconcemed with ensuring that item content and format were \nconsistent with Jungs and Myers theories of psychological \ntype in general and specifically with the theory of opposites \nthat underlie type dichotomies. The general guidelines that \nwere followed through all the revisions of the instrument, \nincluding Form M, were to write or revise items that ac- \ncomplished the following: \n\nMW Allowed people to self-report their preferences accurately \n\nB Reflected the preferences described by Jung for Extraver- \nsion or Introversion (E-I), Sensing or Intuition (S-N), \nand Thinking or Feeling judgment (T-F) \n\nB Reflected the preference for Judging or Perceiving (J-P), \nwhich was created by Isabel Myers to measure the effects \nof the judging and perceiving attitudes in their Extraverted \nappearance, so that this information could be used to \ndetermine a dominant function \n\nM Reflected the assumption that each pole of the dichotomy \nis equally valuable \n\nTheoretically Meaningful Content Before beginning to de- \nvelop the MBTI, Isabel Myers and Katharine Briggs had thor- \noughly studied Jungs Psychological Types for descriptions of \nand subtle clues about type preferences and their interac- \ntions. They had been carefully observing type for more than \ntwo decades and drew on Jungian theory and their observa- \ntions to generate questions that could be evaluated. \n\nOne of the first requirements imposed by ihe type \nhypothesis was that justice must be done to quite opposite \nviewpoints. Each dichotomy requires a choice between \nequally legitimate alternatives. Thus type questions have no \nintrinsic good or bad about them and no right or wrong \nexcept as a certain answer is right for one respondent and \nwrong for another having a different type. The questions \ntherefore needed to deal with self-reportable surface con- \ntrasts in habits, reactions, and points of view that did not \nimply inferiority. The respondent should never be placed on \nthe defensive about his or her response, nor should any \npreference be regarded as superior. \n\nNo question could be very extreme, since accuracy was \nmore important near the middle of the distribution than at \nthe ends. It is fairly easy to write items that separate peo- \nple with very clear preferences on each dichotomy, but \nthis was little help in separating people at the middle of \nthe dichotomy. Similarly, an answer wrongly given by a lot \nof people near the middle was a hindrance. Since all per- \nsons were assigned to one pole or the other on each scale, \n\ndiscrimination in the center of the scale, where preferences \nwere almost evenly divided, was essential. \n\nQuestions were sought not so much for theoretical \nmeaning as for indicating the basic preference that influ- \nences the respondents choice. They were directed to scem- \ningly simple surface behaviors in the hope that they would \nprovide reliable clues 10 the complex and profound patterns \nof behavior that could not otherwise be reached in a self- \nreport instrument. The assumption was that preferences \nthemselves are often not consciously formulated, in which \ncase direct questions about them would not be answered \naccurately. The strategy was to use observable straws in the \nwind\" to make inferences about the direction of the wind \nitself. Many of the items, therefore, can be considered \n\"pointers\" that indicate a direction of preference. They are \nnot direct measures of the quantity of a trait or of the devel- \nopment or ability of the person who holds that preference. \n\nSince the content of the question was only a stimulus to \nevoke a type of reaction, some questions seemed to be trivial. \nThe advantage was that they could be asked without imperti- \nnence and answered in either direction without strain. As \nan encouragement to candor, this harmlessness was a great \nadvantage. Sometimes, however, this seeming simplicity \nbackfires when a respondent indignantly decides that noth- \ning significant can come out of such worthless scraps of \ninformation.\" \n\nIt is important to understand that the content areas of \nthe questions were not meant to cover all domains of the \npreference. Unlike with many educational tests, there was \nno attempt to precisely specify the domain and then to sys- \ntematically write items to cover this domain. The intent \ninstead was to identify any clues about preference that",

The interest in questions was not in the superfi- \ncial behavior reported but in the evidence the questions \ncould provide about the underlying preferences. Although \nthe primary intent was not coverage of a domain, a range of \nbehaviors thought to indicate each preference was included. \nFor example, the E-I questions touch on Extraverted and \nIntroverted differences in sociability, friendship, and inti- \nmacy; detachment or involvement; and outspokenness or \nreserve. This effort is described in greater detail in the fol- \nlowing section. \n\nRichness of the Item Pools Another theoretical criterion that \nwas used to guide item selection was the need to have the \nitem pools for each scale reflect the richness of that prefer- \nence domain. Factor analysis was used in two different ways \nto check for content coverage. Step ll scoring of the MBTI is \nbased on a factor analysis of all the items on Form J of the \nMBTI. As this scoring system demonstrates, each of the four \npreference domains can be further subdivided in this way \ninto a number of subscales. The Form J items in the pool \nwere mapped onto the 20 subscales from the MBTI Step II to \nensure that at least in the initial pool there were items on \n\neach of the four preference scales representing each of the \nsubscales associated with that preference. This was done \nwith the realization, however, that the Step H subscales do \nnot in themselves completely define the preference domains. \nWhile each of the four dichotomies encompasses more than \nis represented by the 5 subscales, the subscales do provide at \nleast a minimal criterion by which the richness of the \ndomain can be measured. \n\nA separate factor analysis was conducted of the rescarch \nform (described below). This analysis also produced a set \nof subfactors associated with each of the four preference \nscales. There was a high degree of overlap between the sub- \nscales arrived at in this analysis and those defined by the \nStep II scoring system. The only differences were a result of \nhaving used two different item pools and two different sam- \nples in the two analyses. \n\nAt each step in the item selection process, the items \nremaining in the pool were compared to these two sets of \nsubscales to ensure that the final scales demonstrated the \nappropriate richness. \n\nForced-Choice Format Questions are presented in forced- \nchoice format primarily because type theory postulates \ndichotomies. All questions offer choices between the poles \nof the same dichotomy, E or I, Sor N, T or EJ or P There are \nno questions that cut across dichotomies. The forced-choice \nformat was required because both poles of a dichotomy are \nvaluable and both are used at different times by everyone. lf \nthe items used a different format, many people would cor- \nrectly respond to both sides of the dichotomy. The goal of \nthe items is to force a series of choices that will determine \nwhich of two valuable or useful behaviors or attitudes is \npreferred by the individual. The forced-choice format also \nhas the advantage of avoiding the bias of acquiescent and \nsocial desirability response sets. \n\nA small number of the Form J items in the initial item \npool had more than two possible responses. These had been \nincluded in previous forms of the Indicator, including Form \nG, for research purposes to determine which of the re- \nsponses was more valid. These items were changed by elim- \ninating one or more of the available responses, so that only \ntwo responses remained. The responses that were elimi- \nnated were those with the lowest weight on Form G. When \nthis criterion did not lead to a clear choice as to which \nresponse to eliminate, the response weights from the Step II \nsubscales were used. \n\nPhrase Questions and Word Pairs MBTI items occur in two \ndifferent forced-choice formats: phrase questions and word \npairs. Originally all questions were phrases followed by a \nchoice. For example, the first question of Form M is \n\nWhen you go somewhere for the day, would you rather \n\n.A plan what you will do and when, or \n\nB^ just go? \n\nConstruction and Properties of the MBTI 141 \n\nWord-pair questions were added for Forms E and E \nExamples from Form M are: \n\nscheduled A B unplanned \n\ngentle A B firm \n\nThe instructions for the word pairs are as follows: \n\nWhich of these words appeals to you more? Think what the words \nmean, not how they look or how they sound. \n\nThe second sentence in these instructions was added in \n1977 with Form G because interviews with persons taking \nForm F revealed that some persons had answered some of \nthe word pairs on the basis of the sound or the appcarance \nof the words, not their meaning. \n\nWording for Comporable Attractiveness Early in the devel- \nopment and testing of questions, the authors discovered \nthat a particular question elicited very different meanings \nfor different types.

The \nresult is that responses may be psychologically rather than \nlogically opposed, a fact that may annoy a number of \nThinking types. Item content is less important than that the \nwords and form of the sentence should serve as a stimulus \nto evoke a type response. Where the attempt to make \nchoices equally appealing did not succeed on earlier forms, \nitem weighting was adopted (discussed later in detail). \n\nEmpirical Criteria A number of empirical criteria were \nalso used at various stages of the item selection process. The \nempirical criteria are primarily concerned with ensuring \nthat the items dilferentiate between people of opposite \npreferences on each scale and on that scale alone. Both \nprediction ratios and IRT item parameters were used to \nselect items. \n\nSatisfactory Prediction Ratios for Each Response A predic- \ntion ratio was calculated for each of the responses for the \n\n290 items from Form J and for the 90 items written by the \ntwo type experts. \n\nThe same cutoff that had been used to select items for \nForm G was used in the revision process to eliminate items \nfrom the initial item pool. Only items with a prediction \nratio greater than .62 for at least one ol the responses were \nretained for further analysis. \n\nSatisfactory Information at the Midpoint of the Scale For \neach item in the initial item pool the amount of information \n\nat the midpoint of the scale was calculated using IRT param- \neters. For MBTI items, information at the midpoint indi- \ncates how well responses to the item separate people into \nthe opposite sides of each dichotomy. Information at the \n\n142 Research \n\nmidpoint is the slope of the item characteristic curve at 0 = 0 \non each scale. No absolute cutoff was used in examining \nthese statistics. The top-performing items on each scale were \nselected for further testing. See Figure 7.1 for examples of \ntwo items with different degrees of information. \n\nNo Significant Gender or Age Differences Form G, like \nmost of the previous forms of the Indictor, uses separate \nweights for males and females for the TF scale. The oppor- \ntunity existed with the 1998 revision to determine whether \nadvanced methodological techniques could be used to select \nitems that would not require separate weighting. Since these \ntechniques can be used to examine item response differences \namong any grouping of subjects and since the MBTI is \nadministered across a very broad range of ages, three differ- \nent age groups were examined. The number of minority \ngroup members was far too small to justify subgroup analy- \nses for race-based subgroups in the Form M standardization \nsample. These analyses will be conducted as Form M data \non minority samples accumulate. \n\nThe analytic technique used to determine whether sig- \nnificant subgroup differences existed in the response to \nMBTI items was differential item functioning (DIF). The \ngeneral idea underlying DIF analyses as applied to the \nMBTI is that people from one subgroup (e.g., males) who \nhave the same overall clarity of preference on a given scale \nshould have essentially the same observed likelihood of \nendorsing a given item in the keyed direction as individuals \nwho belong to another demographic subgroup (e.g., fe- \nmales). Likewise, at the scale level, the goal would be to \nhave little or no cumulative DIF when the items in each of \nthe four MBTI scales are aggregated. Therefore two basic \nquestions were addressed in the DIF analyses: (1) To what \ndegree does each item perform similarly across demo- \ngraphic subgroups of MBTI respondents? and (2) To what \ndegree do subgroup differences in responding become evi- \ndent at the total numbcr of items endorsed level? \n\nA DIF analysis was therefore conducted to identify all \nitems in the initial item pool that showed significant gender \nor age differences. Each item that showed age or gender DIE \nwas examined for content and a decision was made as to \nwhether to retain or drop the item. Farlier rescarch on the \nitems from Forms F and G of the MBTI (Gratias &amp; Harvey, \n1998; Harvey, 1997) had shown that DIF is not a serious \nproblem in the MBTI. That is, although some DIF is seen for \nsome individual items, the sizes of the differences are not \nespecially large, and of greater importance, there is only a \nvery small degree of cumulative DIF at the scale level. The \ncumulative DIF is most important because the classification \ndecision (c.g., is this person more likely to have a preference \nfor E or for 1?) is made at the scale level. Given that the ini- \ntial item pool contained new and revised items, new DIF \nanalyses were conducted on the entire pool. \n\nTwo approaches were used to quantify DIE One approach \nused the Mantel-aenszel (M-H A) technique, popularized",

A major advantage of this \nmethod is the existence of widely used rules-of-thumb for \ngauging the amount and severity of the observed item-level \nDIE  second approach used IRT-based methods that com- \npare the ICCs estimated separately in each subgroup in order \nto provide a measure of overall DIF at the scale level. In this \napproach, test-characteristic curves for the demographic \nsubgroups are compared in order to assess the cumulative \nimpact of the DIF on the expected total number of items that \nwould be endorsed in a given direction. \n\nFive items were eliminated from the item pool at this \npoint for gender DIF. For example, the following item from \nthe E-I scale was eliminated because the responses for men \nand women were significantly different: \n\nDo you usually \n(A^ show your feelings freely, or \nB keep your feelings to yourself? \n\nIn predicting the likelihood of giving the (B) response to \nthis item, it was more useful to know the respondents gen- \nder (males tended to endorse (B) more than did females) \nthan it was to know the persons E-1 preference. Those with \na preference for Introversion also were more likely to \nrespond with (B) than were those preferring Extraversion, \nbut the gender difference was more predictive. Since this \nitem functioned differentially for men and women, it was \ndropped. \n\nGiven that Form G uses separate weights for males and \nfemales on the T-F scale, it was interesting to discover how \nfew items there were in the pool, from any scale, that exhib- \nited significant DIF. As the example above illustrates, not all \nof these items were from the TF scale, either. \n\nFor the age group analyses, three age groups were used: \nunder 35, 35 to 50, and over 50. While it would have been \ndesirable to analyze other age groupings as well as or \ninstead of the above, DIF analysis requires large numbers of \nrespondents in each group. The distribution of ages in the \nsample did not permit other breakdowns. \n\nItems that showed significant DIF by age were examined \ncarefully for content. Some of these items were eliminated \nbecause they contained language that high school or college \nstudents might have found unfamiliar. Others were retained, \nhowever, because in the opinion of the type experts the \nitems might have been tapping some developmental aspects \nof the preferences. For example, the following Form G \nword pair was dropped: \n\nparty  B theater \n\nIt is likely that the response to this item (overwhelmingly \nin favor of party among the younger group) was due to \ncultural changes affecting theater attendance rather than to \ndevelopment issues. Four such items were dropped. \n\nLow Item-to-Scale Correlations with Nonkeyed Scales As was \ndone with all previous forms of the Indicator, item-to-scale \ncorrelations were calculated for each item to each scale. \nlems were analyzed on all scales, not only the scale in- \ntended. The goal was to select items that made a contri- \nbution to only one scale. In some cases, items with high \ncorrelations on more than one scale were eliminated. There \nwere, however, a number ol items in the item pool in differ- \nent stages that had high prediction ratios, high information \nat the midpoint, high correlations with the intended scale, \nand moderate correlations with a nonintended scale. These \nwere primarily items on the S-N and J-P scales that corre- \nlated with the other scale as well as with the intended scale. \nSince these items met other criteria, both theoretical and \nempirical, a number of them were retained. \n\nStep 3: Construct a Research Form \n\nApplying the item selection criteria to the initial item pool \nol 580 items reduced to 264 the number of items for further \nanalysis. A number of different samples were used for the \nitem analyses including college students, adults attending \nMBTI qualifying workshops, and employed adults in vari- \nous organizations throughout the United States. \n\nTo further reduce the pool, the 264 remaining items were \nprinted on a research form along with two pages of demo- \ngraphic questions that included the following categories: \n\nB \"Census data such as age, education, ethnic group, and \nincome \n\nWork status \n\nSatisfaction with work \n\nKinds of work performed \nLeisure activities \n\nRelationship status \nSatisfaction with relationships \nNumber ol children \n\nBirth order \n\nSpirituality \n\nHealth, stress, and coping \nHours of television watched \n\nCompleting the research form were 54 items that make \nup the Fundamental Interpersonal Relations Orientation \nBehavior (FIRO-B) instrument.

The targets (i.e., stratification criteria) included \npercentages of people of age, gender, and ethnic group nec- \nessary to match the 1990 U.S. census. A minimum of three \nattempts was made to contact a respondent at each phone \nnumber. To ensure representativeness, the calls were made \non weekends and evenings as well as during general busi- \nness hours on weekdays. When a person answered the \nphone, trained survey stalf briefly described the research \nstudy and the respondent was asked to state the ages of the \npeople in the household. If anyone in the household could \nsupply data from a targeted demographic group, the partici- \npation of that person was then sought. A payment of one \ndollar was offered as an incentive to participate in the study. \n\nThe survey was conducted over about a two-month \nperiod, during which time 16,000 households were screened. \nApproximately 8,000 households were selected to match the \ntargets, and of these, 4,000 people agreed to participate in \nthe study and were mailed copies of the MBTI Research \nForm along with a self-addressed, stamped envelope. The \nreturn rate for mailed lorms was about 8096, yielding a sam- \nple of approximately 3,200 respondents. \n\nStep 5: Select the Final Items \nfor the Revised MBTI \n\nAn initial factor analysis was conducted on the 264 items \nmaking up the Research Form to confirm that the items \nwere loading on the scales as expected. As with almost all \nother factor analyses of MBTI items, the four MBTI scales \nemerged as the primary factors. Based on this analysis, 26 \nitems were eliminated because they either did not load on \nany of the four scales or loaded on a scale different from the \none for which they had been keyed based on theory. The \ndropped items were primarily those that had been keyed to \neither the SN or the J-P scales but loaded about equally on \nboth, or loaded slighily higher on the nonkeyed scale. \n\nTwo panels of experts, the MBTI Research Advisory \nBoard and another panel of type experts, reviewed the \nremaining 238 items against the theoretical and empirical \ncriteria described above and shown in Table 7.2. As a result \nol this process, 95 items were chosen to make up the 1998 \nMBTI Form M. Ihe characteristics of the final form are \nshown in a later section of this chapter. First, however, is a \ndiscussion ol the development of the scoring procedure. \n\nDevelopment of Scoring \nProcedures for Form M \n\nThe 1998 revision also offered the opportunity to test alterna- \ntive scoring techniques for the MBTI. Two primary methods \nwere chosen for comparison: the prediction ratio method \n(PR) and a three-parameter item response theory (IRI) \n\n144 Research \n\nmodel. The PR method was examined because this is the \nmethod used to score every form of the MBTI since Form C. \nA scoring method based on IRT was examined because \nresearch had suggested that it might provide better preci- \nsion around the midpoint of the scales. At least a half-dozen \nvariations of each of these two primary methods were \ntested. To determine which of these two approaches offered \nthe best method of scoring the MBT] for type, a large-scale \nbest-fit type study was conducted. \n\nBest-Fit Type Study \n\nThis study involved a comparison of various methods of \nscoring sets of MBTI items, using verified, or best-fit, \ntype as the criterion. To conduct this study a number of \nlarge-scale users of the MBTI were contacted and offered \nfree MBTI forms and feedback reports in exchange for their \nparticipation. Over two dozen qualified MBTI users agreed \nto participate. \n\nSix steps were followed in conducting the true type \nstudy: \n\nI.

There was, however, some \nvariation in how the BFQs were administered. Some inter- \npreters asked for the questionnaires to be completed and \nreturned before providing the MBTI results to the person; \nothers returned the MBTI results first and then adminis- \ntered the BFQ. \n\nOver 4,000 Form J answer sheets were distributed, and \napproximately 2,600 best-fit type questionnaires were re- \nturned. After removing cases with missing data, the final \n\nsample consisted of N = 2,116 people for whom scored \nMBTI types could be compared to best-fit types. Approxi- \nmately 56% ol the sample was female, and the mean age \nol the sample was 35 years (SD = 13.6). Of those who \nanswered the question asking them to identify the ethnic \ngroup with which they identified, 87% indicated White, 8% \nBlack, 3% Hispanic, 1.3% Asian, and 1% Native American. \n\nTwo different researchers, one an expert in the PR \nmethod and the other in IRT, were given the response data \nfrom each Form J for which a BFQ was available along with \nthe gender of the respondent. The researchers were given \nno other information about the respondents. The MBTI \ntypes resulting from the standard Form G scoring proce- \ndures, the best-fit types, the besi-fit confidence ratings, and \nall other demographic information were withheld so that \nthe predictions would be independent of any of these data. \nThe researchers each used their own chosen method to \nselect items, to score the responses, and to assign a four- \nletter predicted type to each person in the sample. \n\nAs stated, each of the two basic scoring approaches used \na somewhat different set of items to arrive at the persons \n\ntype. This was necessary because both PR and IRT methods \n\n. arc used not only to score but also to select and to weight _ \n\nitems to arrive at a preference designation on each scale. \nAlthongh not common, there wee sume Gone tier Sd \na high prediction ratio for at least one of the responses but \nprovided little information when used in an IRT approach. \nBecause the purpose of this study was to determine which \nmethod provided the highest accuracy in predicting best-fit \ntype, each researcher had to be free to choose items that \nmaximized the prediction. It was not useful, therefore, to \ncompare the two methods for the same set of items, since \none set would not be optimized for the other approach to \nscoring. \n\nUsing each method, a type was computed for each person \nin the sample. These data were then sent to a third, indepen- \ndent researcher who compared the two different predicted \ntypes with the best-fit type for each person and computed \nhit rates. The hit rates are expressed as a percentage of \npeople for whom there is exact agreement between the best- \nfit type (or preference, when working at the level of individ- \nual scales) and the type (or preference) predicted for that \nperson by one of the scoring methods. For example, if one of \nthe scoring methods predicted that a persons type was \nENFP and the person had concluded, after hearing the \nMBTI interpretation, that her best-fit type was in fact ESTP, \nthen this prediction was counted as a miss when whole \ntypes were being compared. However, when separate com- \nparisons were made of the individual preference scales, these \nresults would yield hits for the E-I and J-P scales and misses \nfor the S-N and T-F scales. Hit rates were computed for the \nentire sample and for different demographic categories (age, \nethnic group, gender) as well as for other breakdowns of the \nsample, such as type of interpretation received (individual \nor group) and type of setting (clinical or organizational). \n\nHit rates were also computed by the confidence level of the \nbest-fit ratings and by preference score ranges. \n\nFight different versions of the PR method and four dif- \nferent versions of the IRT-based procedure were tested. In \neach casc, regardless of which breakdown of the sample was \nanalyzed, one set of predictions from each method was \nclearly superior to the others using that same method. \nTherefore the best prediction from cach method was used \nin the final comparison. \n\nAlternative versions of the PR method included varia- \ntions in the cutoffs used to select items, in the number of dif- \nferent weights used, in the scores around the midpoint that \nwere used to exclude people from the sample, and in how \nmany responses by people of the opposite preference were \nallowed before an item was excluded. The best prediction of \ntype using a variation of the PR method used a cutoff of .66, \nhad seven categories of weights, excluded people whose \ncontinuous scores ranged from 90 to 110 on each scale, and",

One column shows the percentage \nof agreement between best-fit type and the type as deter- \nmined by the best of the PR methods. The other column \nshows the percentage of agreement between best-fit type \nand the type as determined by the best of the IRT methods. \nOverall, the best IRT method produced about a 6% higher \nagreement with best-fil type than did the best of the PR \nmethods. In all other breakdowns the same pattern was \nobserved: IRT produced at least a marginally better percent- \nage of agreement with best-fit type. \n\nBefore concluding this section a number of caveats are in \norder. First, follow-up contacts with most of the inter- \npreters revealed that they had returned the MBTI results to \nthe group before asking the participants to complete the \nBFQ. This procedure likely biased the hit rates in favor of \nthe PR method, since that ts the method that was used to \nprovide the MBTI results received by the participants; it \nmay have been difficult for some people to disagree with the \nofficial-looking computer-gencrated results. \n\nSecond, the best overall hit rate is fairly low: 64%. Other \nbest-fit studies have yielded a range of 64% to 85%. That \nthe overall accuracy in this study is at the low end of this \nrange is probably due to the fact that many different profes- \nsionals interpreted the MBTI to a wide variety of groups \nacross a variety of settings. Previous best-fit studies have \n\nConstruction and Properties of the MBTI 145 \n\nTable 7.3 Comparison of Percentage of \nAgreement with Best-Fit Type for \nPR- and IRT-Based Scoring Methods \nPR IRT \nOverall 58% 64% \nE-I 86.5% 90% \nS-N 86% 88% \nT-F 8576 8676 \nJ-P 86% 88% \nMales 55% 60% \nFemales 60% 67% \n\nNote: N = 2,116. \n\nused much more homogeneous groups, the same inter- \npreter, and standard interpretation procedures (within- \nstudy). More rigorous interpretation standards were sacri- \nficed in this study because large numbers of people were \nneeded to participate so as to yield sufficient numbers of \npeople with slight preference scores, thereby permitting a \nmeaningful analysis. Another factor influencing the hit rate \nis that the IRT method may not have correctly adjusted the \nmidpoint of some of the scales. \n\nDevelopment of the Form M Self-Scorable \nand Template-Scorable Versions \n\nAs with Form G, a self-scorable version of Form M has been \ncreated for use in workshops, classes, and groups when it is \ninconvenient or impossible to administer Form M prior to \nthe group meeting. A template-scorable version of Form M \nis also available for those who wish to hand-score their \nclients answer sheets. The Form M template- and self- \nscorable versions both use the same 93 items to arrive at a \npreference on each of the four scales, as does the standard \nForm M. However, since IRT can be used only on the com- \nputer-scored vetsions for Form M, an alternative scoring \nsystem was developed for the self-scorable and template- \nbased versions. \n\nThe goals of choosing an alternative scoring system for \nthe template- and self-scorable versions of Form M were as \nfollows: \n\nB To achieve a high degree of agreement between the \nresults of the self-scorable and template-scorable ver- \nsions and those that used IRT computer scoring \n\nW To use a system that provides quick scoring 10 save \ntime in the workshop setting or in hand-scoring by the \nprofessional \n\nmw [lo use a scoring method for which hand calculations \nwould bc relatively simple so as to reduce the likelihood \nof making errors in scoring \n\n146 Research \n\n \n\nTable 7.4 Percentage of Agreement \nBetween Form M IRT-Scored \nVersions and Form M Template- \nand Self-Scorable Versions \nPercentage of \nAgreement \nPercentage of After Eliminating \nAgreement Respondents with \nAcross AI! 0 +.10 Point from \nPreference Respondents Midpoint of Scale \nE 93.8 98.1 \n| oa 29:9 \nS 99:3 [00.0 \nN 97.6 99 \nT 97.9 100.0 \nE 98.6 100.0 \nJ 96.8 29. \np 99/9 99.0 \n\nNote: N 2 4,692.

Unlike the PR method, IRT meth- \nods use a likelihood-based approach to scoring. \n\nA fundamental quantity in all of the scoring equations is \nthe expected probability that people with a score of 0 will \nendorse item i in the keyed direction (i.e., choosing the I, \nN, E or Panswer), which is a joint function of the IRT scor- \ning parameters a, b, and c, plus 0 (D isa scaling constant): \n\nrn eDo (6 - b) \n(9) eG TADS C) EN E \n\nA maximum likelihood function can be defined based on the \nexpected item-endorsement probability as follows (n = \nnumber of items, u = the 1/0 keyed item response): \n\nl (u | 0) = n PQ u, \nIn} (ul 8) = X [u In P.) + [((1u)] In (1 P)] \n\nTo obtain the estimate of each persons 0 score, the above \nfunction is evaluated across a range of possible 0 values, and \nthe 0 value that produces the most likely value for the like- \nlihood function (i.e., highest in absolute value) is used as the \nestimate of that persons 8 score. An example of likelihood \nfunctions for two respondents to the MBTI is shown in Fig- \nure 7.4. The logic of the IRT scoring procedure is to hypoth- \nesize that the persons score could be any value of 0. The \nlikelihood of these hypotheses (i.e., each 0) is then tested \nusing two pieces of data: the persons actual repsonses to \neach item and all of the information that is known about the \ncharacteristics of all of the items. The 0 that has the maxi- \nmum likelihood is then chosen as the best estimate of that \npersons score. If that score is to the right of the midpoint, \nthen the persons letter is I, N, E or P. depending on the scale; \nif the 0 score is to the left of the midpoint, then the persons \nletter is E, S, T, or J. Both of the individuals whose likelihood \nfunctions are shown in Figure 7.4 would be classified as hav- \ning a preference for Introversion because the maximum \nvalue (i.e., the highest point) on both functions occurs to \nthe right, or Introverted side, of the midpoint. \n\nAdditionally, the height of the likelihood function at its \nmaximum point also provides useful information: All other \nthings being equal, higher maximum values are more desir- \nable and are associated with item-response profiles that are \nmore consistent or plausible. \n\nOnce an estimate of 0 has been established using the \nmaximum likelihood method, a Bayesian approach is used \nto refine the estimation. The Bayes expected a posteriori \n(EAP) estimate of 0 is used. \n\n0- yen Xk L (xx) w (x) \n\nye L (xx) w (xx) \n\n0.0 \n\nLog Likelihood \n\n-80 \n\nE E-HNEIEHILG 14 =A -1.0 8 Q 4 \nExtraversion \n\nOBS wmm: | \n\nFigure 7.4 Maximum Likelihood Curves for Two Different People \n\nThe advantage of using the Bayes EAP scoring method is \nthat the EAP estimate ts effectively a weighted maximum \nlikelihood estimate of 0, giving more weight to the areas of \nthe assumed @ distribution in which higher numbers of \nindividuals are present and less weight to @ values in less \ndense portions of the distribution. \n\nTie-Breaking Procedure \n\nUsing IRT scoring. it is very rare lor a persons score on any \nof the four preference scales to land exactly at the 0 that \ndefines the midpoint of that scale. Given that the self- and \niemplate-seorable versions do not use the more precise \nIRT scoring, however, ties may be somewhat more com- \nmon. For all scoring systems, a tie-breaker continues to be \nused with Form M. All ties are broken in the same direc- \ntion as with previous forms of the Indicator: 1, N, F, or P",

    "content": "When a tie occurs, then the persons preference becomes I, \nN, E or P, depending on the scale, and that persons score \nbecomes I. \n\nThe logic behind breaking ties in favor of the N or P \npreferences is that these are the less frequent types in the \npopulation. If a person is that close to the preference (zero \ndifference), there is probably some environmental response \npressure from the majority preference. This pressure can \nresult in answers conforming to the majority and contrary \nto true preferences. Thus the persons true type is proba- \nbly N or P \n\n2 00 02 04 06 08 IHO 12 l4 l6 \nTheta \n\nConstruciion and Properties of the MBTI i \n\nEO \n\nIntroversion \n\nmum) \n\nOn the E-l scale, recent estimates of the distribution of \npreferences in the population (see Tables 7.14 and 7.15; \nHammer &amp; Mitchell, 1996) suggest that the proportion of \nExtraverts and Introverts is about equal. However, the \nmethod of breaking ties in the favor of 1 was retained \nbecause in many settings there is still cultural pressure to \nbehave as an Extravert. \n\nOn the T-F seale the tie-breaker is in the direction of F \nfor men because men are more socialized to give I re- \nsponses. For consistency and for continuity with previous \nmethods, the same tie-breaker is used for women, that is, in \nthe direction of E \n\nFinally, it is important to understand that the decision \nrules for the tie-breakers should not be overinterpreted. \nThe primary purpose of a tie-breaker is to provide a stimu- \nlus for starting a conversation with the respondent about \nwhy he or she answered the questions about equally in both \ndirections. \n\nKinds of Results Available from Form M \n\nRegardless of which version of Form M is used, the goal is \nto arrive at one of the 16 types, and all versions report the \nwhole type. For respondents who complete the computer- \nscored versions of Form M, that is, those versions relying \non IRT scoring, there are four additional kinds of results \navailable for each scale: a preference letter, a preference \nclarity index, a preference clarity category, and a continuous \n\n148 Research \n\nscore. For the self- and template-scorable versions of Form \nM, an additional score is available: the raw points for cach \npole of cach dichotomy. Table 7.5 summarizes the kinds of \nresults available for cach version of Form M. \n\nRaw Points Raw points are used only on the self- and \ntemplate-scorable versions of Form M. Eight raw points are \ncalculated, one for each of the dichotomous preferences (E, \nL S, N, T, E J, P). As described in Chapter 5, these points are \ncalculated by simply summing the number of responses for \neach pole of each preference scale. Raw points are only an \nintermediate step used to determine the persons preference \non a scale and his or her preference clarity category (see \nbelow); they are not meant to be interpreted. \n\nPreference Letter As with previous versions of the \nIndicator, the result for each of the four dichotomous scales \nis reported to the client in the form of a letter, which is a \nshorthand for which pole of each dichotomy is preferred. \n\nAs described earlier in this chapter, the IRT-based scoring \nprocedure yields a score that, in IRT terminology, is called 0. \nTo determine a persons preference on a given scale, the 0 for \nthat scale is computed using the IRT three-parameter model. \nIf 0 falls to the right of the midpoint of the preference scale, \nthe persons preference is determined to be I, N, F or P. \ndepending on the scale. If 0 falls to the left of the midpoint, \nthe preference is E, S, T or J, depending on the scale. \n\nPreference Clarity Index The name for the numeral that \nis associated with a preference on Form M is the preference \nclarity index (pci). This index is analogous to thc \npreference score in previous forms of the Indicator. The \nname was changed to preference clarity index for several \nrcasons: \n\nB The phrase preference clarity better indicates the real \nmeaning of the number. \n\nBW The word index is more appropriate for a type indicator \nsince it means \"something used or serving to point out; a \nsign, token, or indication [as in] 'a true index of his char- \nacter and something that directs attention to some \nfact or condition\" (Random House, 1987). \n\nW Use of the word score had led to misinterpretations of the \nmcaning of the preference score. \n\nB The word score implies a trait approach that is inappro- \npriate for a type indicator. \n\nTo calculate the preference clarity index the maximum \nand minimum 9 for each scale were determined using the \nnational sample data. The persons 0 score on a given prefer- \nence scale is divided by the maximum 9 for that scale. This \nratio is multiplied by 30 and then rounded up to the nearest \npositive integer. This puts all of the preference clarity \nindexes on a 1-to-30 scale. \n\nThe preference clarity index is thus a ratio showing how \nconsistently the person answered the questions on that scale \ncompared with the maximum possible score achievable on",

This ratio takes into account the fact that in IRT scor- \ning the MBTI items have different weights, reflecting how \nwell they discriminate between pcople of opposite prefer- \nences. The pci also reflects the fact that the IRT scoring pro- \ncedure provides a correction for nonlinearity and for social \ndesirability. \n\nThis new index solves one of the problems associated \nwith the old preference scores. Because of the manner in \nwhich preference scores were calculated, there were widely \ndifferent ranges across the four scales. For example, the \nmaximum possible preference score for the F preference on \nForm G was 39 for males, while the maximum possible \npreference score for the T preference was 65. The same \nnumber therefore had different meanings depending on \nwhich preference was being considered. The same disparity \noccurred across scales as well. A score of F 30 on the T-F \nscale for a male indicated a very clear preference, while a \nscore of E 30 on the E-1 scale (where the maximum is 53 \nfor E) indicated only a moderate preference. Standardizing \nthe pci makes interpretation more straightforward. \n\nWhile the interpretation is made easier by the use of the \npci, researchers must be cautioned that its use in correla- \ntions may attenuate the results. In any sample, the pci will \nhave less variance than will the continuous scores. There- \nlore any correlations based on the pci, especially in samples \nof people with very clear preferences, may be lower than \nwould he the case if continuous scores were used. \n\nPreference Clarity Categories To aid in interprctation \nand to lessen the chance that preference scores will be \noverinterpreted, many of the computer-generated inter- \npretive reports associated with Form G display the pref- \nerence scores on a grid using bar graphs. The horizontal \naxis on this grid is labeled using four categories. Starting \nat the zero point and moving toward the end of the axis \nin either direction, the labels and the corresponding Form G \n\npreference scores are as follows: slight (1-9), moderate \n\n(11-19), clear (2139, or 31 for F), and very clear (41 or \nhigher, or 31 for F). \n\nForm M employs the same labels in the same order and \nrefers to them as the preference clarity categories. The pec has \ntwo different sources: the pci of computer-scored forms and \nthe raw points of template scored and self-scored versions. \nWhen using the computer-scored versions of Form M, \nthese categories are associated with pci ranges as follows: \nslight (1-5), moderate (6-15), clear (16-25), and very clear \n(26-30). When using the template- and self-scorable versions \nof Form M, these categories are associated with ranges of the \nraw points for the preferred pole. Since each scale has a differ- \nent number of items, and therefore a different number of pos- \nsible raw points, the ranges differ depending on the scale. See \nTable 5.4 for how to convert raw points into preference clarity \ncategories. This table is printed on the self-scorable form and \non the templates used in hand-scoring. \n\nAs with Form G, the preference clarity categories are to \nbe treated as heuristics to aid in interpretation, not as cut- \noff points for decision making. See Chapter 6 for recom- \nmendations on how all MBTI results are to be interpreted. \n\nContinuous Scores As with the previous versions of the \nMBTI, results are also available as continuous scores for use \nby researchers wishing to correlate MBTI scores with the \nscores of other instruments or criterion variables. The \ncontinuous scores are the values of 0 that result from IRT \nscoring. As such, they are available only for the computer- \nscored versions of the Indicator. \n\nWhen researchers desire to correlate MBTI scores with \nthose of other instruments, it is important that they use the \n0 scores and not the preference clarity indexes. Because a \npci is basically a compression of the full range of 0 on a \ngiven scale, it generally will have less variance than will the \ncorresponding distribution of 0. This means that correla- \ntions based on the pci could suffer from restriction of range \nin certain samples and thus be attenuated. \n\nDetermining the Midpoint \nof the Scales for Form M \n\nTo determine the midpoint of each of the scales, additional \nanalyses were conducted. Generally, with an IRT scoring sys- \ntem, the midpoint of the scale occurs at 0 = 0.0. However, \ngiven that precision around the midpoint is of primary",

For each scale \nthe sample was divided into two categories, one for each of \nthe preferences on that scale. The frequency of the pci was \nplotted for each category and then placed on the same scale. \nThis allowed for a graphic examination of the effect of vari- \nous placements of the midpoint for each of the scales. \n\nPrior to any adjustments (i.e., with the midpoint of all \nscales set at 0 = 0.0), the agreement between best-fit type \nand the type determined by the IRT scoring program was \n72%. As shown in Table 7. 6, the percentage of agreement \nusing these unadjusted midpoints was 92% for the E-I, \nS-N, and J-P scales and 86% for the TF scale. \n\nAs shown in Table 7. 7, examination of the distributions \nof unadjusted preference clarity indexes for people of differ- \nent best-fit preferences revealed a number of misses, with \nby far most of the misses being on only one scale. For \nexample, a number of people who declared Feeling as a \nbest-fit preference on the T-F scale had a pci on that scale \nindicating that they should be classified as a Thinking type. \nThe same condition was observed on the S-N and J-P \nscales. Consequently it was determined that a slight adjust- \nment to the midpoint of the S-N, T-E and J-P scales was \nwarranted. The midpoint of the E-I scale was not changed. \nThe adjustments were as follows: \n\nE-I None. \n\nS-N If the unadjusted preference clarity index is \nbetween O and I in the S direction, classify as N. \n\nT-F If the unadjusted preference clarity index is \nbetween 0 and 2 in the T direction, classify as E \n\nJ-P If the unadjusted preference clarity index is \nbetween 0 and I in the J direction, classify as P. \n\nSo, for example, if the pci for an individual was J 1, that \nperson would be classified as a P, because in the best-fit \nsample these people had declared that P was a better fit than \nwas J.

The goal was, \ntherefore, absolute gain, not net gain. This is why there were \nno adjustments made to the midpoint of the E-I scale. Mov- \ning the midpoint on this scale in either direction would have \ngained some matches but also created some mismatches. \n\nAnother consideration was that the midpoint adjust- \nment not create additional mismatches between Form M \nand Form G. Therefore, when an adjustment was consid- \nered, the Form M preference clarity indexes were plotted \nagainst people whose Form G preferences were known in \nanother sample, and the effect of the adjustment on the \nForm M-Form G match was examined.

Some statistics \non Form G are included here because the comparisons can \nhelp in understanding the changes made in moving from \nForm G to Form M. For a complete reporting of the charac- \nteristics of Form G see Myers and McCaulley (1985). \nBecause Form M is now considered the standard form of \nthe Indicator, the emphasis here is on presenting data that \ndescribe Form M. Topics covered in this section include \ncomparison of the number of items per scale and of each \nformat for both forms. This is followed by information \nabout the frequency of omissions for Form M as well as a \ncomparison of the types resulting from Form M and Form \nG. We also look at information relating to the purity and \nindependence of the preference scales, including item-to- \nscale correlations and scale intercorrelations for both forms. \nThe characteristics ol the national sample used as the basis \nof the Form M item selection and scoring procedures are \npresented. Finally, we discuss an analysis of DIF in Form M \nby gender and age. \n\nItem Comparison \n\nForm M consists of 93 items, onc less than the number of \nscored items on Form G. Table 7.8 shows the breakdown by \nscale and by item format for both Form M and Form G. \nThese figures demonstrate that few changes were made in \nthe number of items per scale or in the number of items of \ndifferent format in moving from Form G to Form M. \n\nTable 7.9 Frequencies of Omissions \non Form M \n\nOmissions n % Cum. % \n0 25272 83% 83% \n| 283 976 9276 \n2 72 2% 95% \n3 54 2% 97% \n4 33 1% 98% \n5 20 126 98% \n6 10 0% 99% \ny 9 0% 99% \n8 25 1% 100% \n9 8 0% 100% \n\n10 | 0% 100% \n[I | 0% 100% \n\nNote: N = 3,036. See Appendix for a descripuon of the sample. \n\nSource: National sample \n\nAnother similarity between the two forms is evident in the \nordering of the items on Form M. The ordering was designed \nto correspond to that of Form G as much as possible. All \nitems on Form M that were taken directly from Form G were \nplaced, to the extent possible, in exactly the same position on \nForm M as they appeared on Form G. When a Form G item \nwas dropped, every attempt was made to place a new or \nrevised item from the same scale in that position on Form M. \nThe ordering of items thus provides a strong sense of conti- \nnuity for MBTI users and in addition retains many effects of \nhaving the items ordered in the manner designed by Myers. \n\nLongtime users of Form G will note that most of the new \nor revised items that were introduced with Form M occur on \nthe second half of the form. For example, among the first \n50 items on Form M are 39 items from Form G. These were \nthe items on Form G that had the greatest power to differen- \ntiate people of opposite preferences and were therefore also \nthose items that carried weights of 1 and 2 for their responses. \nItems in the second half of Form G were more likely to carry \nweights of 0 and, 1, and it was these items that were more \noften replaced by new or revised items on Form M. \n\nOmissions on Form M \n\nAs with Form G, omissions are permitted on Form M in the \nbelief that greater validity is achieved by the elimination of \ndoubtful answers. Type can then be indicated by preferences \nto the item responses a person is reasonably sure about, \nuncontaminated by guessing. The IRT scoring program uses \nall of the information available in producing a type. In prac- \ntice, there are typically few omissions. Table 7.9 shows the",

A person may lcave a large \n\nConstruction and Properties of the MBTI 151 \n\nnumber of blanks on an answer sheet for a number of rea- \nsons: a lack of understanding of the vocabulary or sentences \ndue to low reading ability in English; an inability to indicate \nprelerences by responding to MBTI items; or a conscious \ndesire not to reveal oneself, perhaps due to misunderstand- \ning of or lack of trust in the testing environment. \n\nMore important than the total number of omissions is \nthe number of omissions per scale. For exampie, 12 omis- \nsions spread evenly across all four scales will cause less of \na problem than if all 12 occur on one scale, or two. So that \nboth respondents and interpreters can take this into \naccount during the interpretation process, omissions per \nscale are reported on most MBTI computer-scored narra- \ntives and profiles. In addition, if there are a number of omis- \nsions above a certain level per scale, this fact is flagged and a \ncautionary comment is printed. Specifically, this occurs if \nthere are more than four omissions on the E-I or J-P scale \nand more than five omissions on the longer S-N and T-F \nscales. These cutoffs were determined by examining scale \nreliabilitics for people with different levels of omissions. \n\nRelationship Between Form M \nand Form G Results \n\nA sample of 101 adults from a church congregation in a small \nMidwestern town were administered both Form G and Form \nM at the same time. The mean age of the sample was 48 years \n(SD = 18), and the sample was composed of 61% females. \nThe relationship between the two forms is shown in Table \n7.10. The overall agreement of whole types was 60% between \nthe two forms, which is somewhat better than what would be \nexpected given the level of agreement on the independent \nscales (i.e., if we assume that the scales are independent and \nmultiply the percentage of agreement on all four seales, the \nprobability of overall agreement would be 54%). Because a \npersons whole type is determined by his or her preferences \non the four separate scales, the overall agreement between \nthe two forms is somewhat constrained by the level of agree- \nment on the four scales. \n\nlt is interesting to note that the lowest agreement is on \nthe S-N scale, which is the longest scale but also the one \nwith the greatest number of Form G items retained on \nForm M. The sample on which these data are based was \npredominantly S. Changes for a number ol these people \nwho scored around the midpoint on either form may be the \ncause of the lower level of agreement on this scale. \n\nIn conclusion, it should be noted that the level of 60% \nagreement between Form G and Form M on whole types is \nactually higher, and in some cases quite a bit higher, than is \nobserved between two adminstrations of Form G in 10 of \nthe 11 studies reported in the 1985 MBTI Manual. \n\nItem-to-Scale Correlations \n\nIn the development of the MBTI, item analyses always \nincluded both item-to-seale correlations and prediction \nratios fot cach response to all scales, not simply the scale for \n\n152 Research \n\nwhich the item was designed. Any item that loaded simi- \nlarly on more than one scale was eliminated. On Form G, \nbiserial correlations computed between the retained items \nand the scores of other scales had a median absolute corre- \nlation range of .07 to .12, as compared to a range of .43 to \n55 when correlated with the items own scale, \n\nThe item-to-scale correlations for Form M are shown in \nTable 7.11. As expected, the median correlations of the \nForm M items on each scale are considerably higher with \ntheir own scale than with the other three scales. The only \nexception to this trend is the moderate correlation of S-N \nitems with the J-P scale, and vice versa. \n\nScale Intercorrelations \n\nIntercorrelations of continuous scores for the Form G data- \nbank sample and for various Form M samples arc shown in \nTable 7.12. These figures give an estimate of the size of \nintercorrelations to expect, depending on the distribution \nof types in a particular research sample. In naturally occur- \nring samples, larger than expected scale intercorrelations \ncan often be attributed to a greater representation than nor- \nmal of a particular preference. There was also a trend in the \nForm G analyses (Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985, Table 9.7) for \nintercorrelations between J-P and S-N, and J-P and T-E \nhigher in older age groups. \n\nAs expected, the largest correlations in the Form M sam- \nples are almost always between S-N and JP, and some sam- \nples also show a relationship between T-F and J-P. The \nintercorrelation between the S-N and J-P scales for Form M \nis similar to, if not somewhat higher than, the correlation \nbetween these two scales for the Form G databank, \nalthough this difference is likely attributable to the hetero-",

The positive \ncorrelations between S-N and J-P probably reflect a fact \nabout the types themselves. Sensing types typically prefer to \nrely on past experience and dislike unexpected events that \nrequire a rapid assessment of new possibilities. A preference \nfor Judging leads to a life that is planned and consistent, \ndecreasing the numbers of such unexpected events. Intn- \nitive types, on the other hand, are attracted to luture possi- \nbilities and new constructions of events. The Perceiving \nattitude kecps the door open to an incoming strcam of these \nnew possibilities. \n\nDifferential Item Functioning \n\nAfter the 93 items were chosen for Form M, the differential . \n\nitem functioning (DIF) analysis was repeated to once again \nexamine any possible differential effects of items by gender \nor by age. Although both item- and scale-level analyses \nwere performed, the main focus of these analyses was on \nthe test-level DIF results, which directly provide an index of \nthe bottom line difference that would be expected on the \nbasis of demographic factors when the MBTI is used in \npractice. That is, it is relatively common to find that a few \n\nTable 7.10 Relationship Between \nForm M and Form G \nin a Sample of Adults 5 \n\nCorrelation Between Percentage of Agreement \n\nScale Continuous Scores in Classification \nE-I .90 90% \n\nS-N 87 79% \n\nT-F .89 87% \n\nJ-P 89 87% \nOverall 60% \nAgreement \n\nNote: N = 101 See Appendix for a description of the sample. \n\nSource Trinity Lutheran Church. \n\nindividual items exhibit low to modest levels of DIF at the \nitem level (e.g., Drasgow, 1987); however, such effects typi- \ncally become a practical concern only to the extent that \nthey exert a significant distorting effect that is visible at the \nscale level of analysis. \n\nFor the item-level DIF results, values of the Mantel- \nHaenszel (M-H A) statistic (an index of both the magnitude \nand direction of the DIF) that exhibit a significant chi- \nsquare and are in excess of 1.5 are viewed as being poten- \ntially \"significant\" in magnitude. With respect to interpret- \ning the individual M-H A, the sign of each statistic indicates \nwhether the \"focal\" group (females in the sex-DIE and \nyoung/old individuals in the age-DIF comparisons) scores \nabove or below the reference group (males, or middle- \naged). Thus negative values for the gender comparison on \nthe J-P scale would indicate that in a group of females and \nmales that are matched with respect to clarity of their MBTI \npreference, females will be less likely to choose the keyed \n(P) response to the item than will males. \n\nThe test-level M-H A results for gender and age are graphi- \ncally summarized in Figures 7.5-7.8 for gender-based DIF \nand in Figures 7.9-7.12 for age-based DIF. Each of these \nfigures shows test characteristic curves (TCC) for each of the \ncomparisons. TCCs arc exactly analogous to the item char- \nacteristic curves shown earlier, but instead of modeling the \nprobability of responding to a given item in the keyed direc- \ntion, they show probability of responding in the keyed \ndirection on the entire scale. \n\nIn Figures 7.5-7.12 the expected difference between sub- \ngroups in terms of total numbers of items endorsed in the \nkeyed direction is shown; as an inspection of these results \nrcadily indicates, these TCCs are quite close across much of \nthe scale and typically much closer at the type cutoff points. \nThe age-based results are somewhat larger than the gender- \nbased DIF at the points of maximum divergence, which is \nlikely due to the fact that some of the items showing age \nDIF were retained because they were believed to tap devel- \nopmental differences that should not be eliminated from the \n\nConstruction and Properties of the MBTI 153 \n\nTable 7.11 Item-to-Scale Correlations for Form M \n\nItems E- Scale S-N Scale T-F Scale J-P Scale \n\nE- items Median .52 |1 07 .04 \nMinimum .43 25 ,17 .14 \nMaximum .76 .03 .05 Ol \n\nS-N items Median ~10 53 06 28 \nMinimum .15 .38 -.17 10 \nMaximum .04 .65 25 39 \n\nT-F items Median .06 .05 .53 zl \nMinimum -.13 .06 .36 .04 \nMaximum .00 .20 .65 2l \n\nJ-P items Median 205 .30 10 59 \nMinimum .14 12 .04 .39 \nMaximum 03 46 .3l .72 \n\n(es a ee ee ee IE 7. eee \n\nTable 7.12 \nSample N E-I:S-N E-I:T-F \nForm G \nForm G databank 32,671  08 .07 \nForm M \nNational sample 3,036 .18 12 \nCRI sample 154 .20 .16 \nTrinity Lutheran Church 0l 24 07 \nEmployee Career \nEnrichment Program 98 .04 03 \nTest-retest sample 424 .25 APA \nlowa State University 279 .13 18 \nMiddle TN State University 198 06 .04 \nFairview Health Services 261 .10 -.10 \n\nIntercorrelations of Continuous Scores for Form G and Form M \n\nE-1:J-P S-N:T-F S-N:J-P T-F;J-P \nE 13 38 2l \n.09 no 47 48 \nL OF 08 49 20 \n-20 40 53 35 \n\n07 T2 49 239 \n.19 B 38 27 \n.19 22 54 28 \n-44 26 Al 09 \n10 ~06 42 08 \n\nSara ee de S AU o2 pL HR ACC WD TT WEN eT a Se IPIE a",

Even at their largest, however, the expected \ncross-subgroup cumulative differences in item responding \nrepresent only a fraction of a single item response, suggesting \nthat whatever DIF is present is relatively minor, and/or it \neffectively cancels out across the items in each scale when \nscale-level scores are estimated. \n\nThe results of the M-H A analyses at the item level were \nalso quite positive, showing that for the gender and age com- \nparisons no E-I items exceeded the 1.5 cutoff on gender, and \nonly one did in the two columns of age comparisons (i.e., \nyoung versus middle-aged and old versus middle-aged); for \nS-N, no items did; for T-F only one item exceeded the 1.5 \ncutoff (on old versus middle-aged); and for J-P, two items \n\nexceeded this minimum cutoff for the gender-DIF analyses. \nHowever, if the more stringent cutoff of A = 2.0 for targeting \npotential problem items is used, no items from any of these \nscales can be flagged as producing appreciable levels of DIF \nwhen using the M-H A technique. \n\nIn summary, these results are consistent with earlier DIF \nstudies of the MBTI in showing that there does not appear to \nbe any appreciable cumulative DIF on the basis of age or gen- \nder across the four MBTI scales. The fact that the TF scale, \nwhich in the past used a gender-based differential scoring \nsystem, exhibited some of the lowest levels of DIF in these \nanalyses can be viewed as a compelling argument for doing \naway with subgroup-based scoring systems for the MBTI. \n\n154 Research \n\n21 = um females \namm males \n\no \n\nProbability \n\nET zi 0 \nTheta \n\nFigure 7.5 E-I Test Characteristic Curves for Men and Women \n\n30-1 - mm m females \namm males \n\n20 \nm \n5 \nB \n \na \n\n10 \n\n0 \n\n= = 0 \nTheta \n\nFigure 7.7 T-F Test Characteristic Curves for Men and Women \n\n30 \n\nm mm females \namem males \n\n20 \nE \nFa \n5 \nO \na \n\nlO \n\n0 \n\n=p.) zl 0 | 2 \nTheta \n\nFigure 7.6 S-N Test Characteristic Curves for Men and Women \n\n30 m m m females \nmam males \n\n20 \n[a \n3B \n5 \n9 \na. \n\n10 \n\n0 \n\n a 0 | 2 \nTheta \n\nFigure 7.8 J-P Test Characteristic Curves for Men and Women \n\nConstruction and Properties of the MBTI  155 \n\n30 m m younger \nmums Older \n\nm mm younger \nmmm Older \n\n21 \n\nProbability \n\no \n\nProbability \n\nao - 0 | 2 \nTheta Theta \n\nFigure 7.10 S-N Test Characteristic Curves for Older and \n\nFigure 7.9 E-l Test Characteristic Curves for Older and Younger \nYounger Respondents \n\nRespondents \n30 m m m younger 22 a ma younger \nmus Older mmum Older p \n\nProbability \nProbability \n\n. o \n\nTheta Theta \n\nFigure 7.12 J-P Test Characteristic Curves for Older and \n\nFigure 7.11 T-F Test Characteristic Curves for Older and \nYounger Respondents \n\nYounger Respondents \n\n156 Research \n\nThe National Sample and the \nNational Representative Sample \n\nA national sample of adults over age 18 was collected and \nused for the item analyses for Form M. This was the first \ntime a national sample was used for MBTI item analyses. \nResults from this sample of about 3,000 people are pre- \nsented in various places in this chapter and in other chap- \nters. In most plaees in this manual, where the national sam- \nple is referred to, it mcans this entire data set, with no \nadjustments made to mode! the population. (The charaeter- \nistics of this sample are described in the Appendix.) This is \nbecause for most calculations it is more important to have \nraw data from a large sample. In some instances, however, \nit was desirable to have a national representative sample \n(NRS), which is described below. The NRS was used when \nthe distribution of types in a sample of intcrest was being \ncompared to a base population. In these instances, the base \npopulation was the NRS. \n\nThe raw data trom the national sample did not entirely \nachieve the goal of representing the U.S. adult population \nbecause, as with previous attempts to collect a national sam- \nple, White women tended to be overrepresented among \nthose who returned the survey forms, and Black men tended \nto underrespond. While national random phone surveys \ngenerally yicld an adequate representation of minority group \nmembers, this was not the case with the MBTI sampling. \nApparently members of minority groups arc less likely to \ncomplete psychological instruments than they are to com- \nplete political or other sociological surveys. Therefore, \nbecause the goal was to show the distribution of types in a \nnational representative sample (NRS) of the U.S. population, \nthe data trom the national sample were recompiled. \n\nTwo different methods were used to arrive at a represen- \ntative sample. After applying the two methods, the type and \npreference distributions were caleulated on both revised \nsamples. The goal of both methods was to have a final sam- \nple that matched the 1990 U.S. census on gender and ethnic \ngroup. It was not possible to match for age beeause the \nnational sample included only those 18 years and older.",

This method resulted in a sam- \nple of 1,450 persons. The other method was to weight the \nresults of people from the underrepresented groups in such \na way that the final sample would mateh the census. This \nmethod resulted in a total sample of 3,009 persons. \n\nAs would be expected, the two methods yielded almost \nidentical distributions of types, with the largest difference \nbeing 1.6% for male ISTPs; most other differences were less \nthan 0.5%. Consequently, since the weighted category \nmethod resulted in less loss of data, the national sample \nbased on this method is reported here. \n\nTable 7.13 Characteristics of the National \nRepresentative Sample \n\nGroup n % % in Census \nMales 1,478 49.1% 49.0% \nFemales 1,531 50.976 51.0% \nWhite 2,495 83.3% 80.3% \nBlack 411 13.7% 12.1% \nOther 89 3.0% 7.6% \n\nNote: N = 3,009.

However, the number of \nHispanics is not reported with the main ethnic breakdown in \nthe U.S. census. Therefore, solely for the purpose of compar- \ning the demographics in the NRS with census demographics, \nthe same strategy used by Hammer and Mitchell (1996) was \nused with the current sample. Those indicating Hispanic as \ntheir ethnic group in the current national sample were pro- \nportionally assigned to the White and Black categories. Note, \nhowever, that in the actual sample Hispanics were included \nand weighted proportionally as a separate group. \n\nTable 7.13 shows how the current national representa- \ntive sample compares to the census data by gender and eth- \nnic group. The primary difference is that the current \nnational sample contains about half the percentage of peo- \nple in the *other\" ethnic group category. Otherwise the \nproportions closely match those of the 1990 U.S. census. \n\nTable 7.14 and Table 7.15 show the distribution of types \nand preferences for males and females in the national reprc- \nsentative sample, respectively. The distributions for Blacks \nand Hispanics are presented in Chapter 14 of this manual. \n\nPrior to this sample, the best estimate of the distribution \nof types in a national representative sample was the 1996 \nsample reported by Hammer and Mitchell (1996), which \nused Form G and employed a rolling norms procedure. In \nthis procedure, data are usually collected sequentially, going \nfrom one site to another, until the demographic characteris- \ntics of the overall sample (e.g., the percentage of people rep- \nresenting different age groups) matches predetermincd tar- \nget levels. \n\nIn the current national representative sample, there are \nshghtly more Introverts than Extraverts among males, while \nthe reverse is true for females. In the 1996 sample, Introverts \nwere slightly more common for both genders. The propor- \ntion of Sensing types ts between 71% and 75% for both men \nand women, which is slightly more for the men than in the \n1996 sample.

All decisions concerning items, scor- \ning, and validation were driven by the demands of the the- \nory. The goal was to yield an instrument that could be used \nto reliably sort people into types, not to measure traits. \n\nSince its beginning, the Indicator has undergone constant \nscrutiny to determine ways to improve it. Changes were \nmade to item wording, item formats, weights, standardiza- \ntion samples, and scoring procedures. All potential changes \nwere measured against two standardspsychometric prin- \nciples and theoretical congruence. This review of the Indi- \ncators development illustrates why in Chapter 2 of this \nmanual the history of the MBTI is characterized as A Tra- \ndition of Change.\" \n\nThe revision of the MBTI described in this chapter, \nwhich culminated in the 93-item Form M, remained truc \n\nto this tradition. All decisions were guided by both theoret- \nical and empirical criteria. Item response theory methods, \nderived from modern test theory, were used to select items \nthat better discriminated between people of opposite pref- \nerences. An improvement was made in classification of \nrespondents around the midpoint.  new scoring method- \nology was introduced using the prediction of best-fit type \nas the criterion. This same criterion was also used to deter- \nmine the midpoint of the scales. For the first time, the \nstandardization sample used as a foundation for scoring \nwas based on a national sample of adults. These improve- \nments in the psychometric properties of the Indicator, \nalong with the data presented in the following chapters, \nsuggest that users can continue to rely on the MBTI as a \nmeasure of psychological type. \n\nReliability and \n\nMeasurement Precision \n\nInternal Consistency \nReliability Estimates \n\nTest-Retest Reliability Estimates \n\nMeasurement Precision Using \nthe IRT Method \n\nConclusion \n\nhis chapter addresses the reliability of the Myers- \n\nBriggs Type Indicator, particularly that of the new \nForm M. Data from the national sample (see Chapter 7 for a \ndescription) are presented. The first topic to be examined, \ninternal consistency reliability estimates, includes discus- \nsion of two different methods: split-half reliability and coef- \nficient alpha. To permit reliability comparisons with other \ninstruments, we report continuous score reliability: esti- \nmates for the four preference scales. Sample characteristics \nthat may affect reliabilities are also discussed. \n\nThe second topic is test-retest reliability estimates, or",

Again we report continu- \nous score reliability estimates for the four preference scales. \nHowever, since MBTI scale scores are assumed to reflect \nunderlying dichotomies, and the major interest of most \nMBTI users is the consistency of remaining the same type, \nwe also report reliabilities that reflect these hypothesized \ndichotomies. \n\nThe concept of rcliability deals not only with estimating \ninternal consistency and replicability over time but also with \nthat part of the variance in reliability estimates that is attrib- \nutable to the characteristics of respondents. Ihe reliability \nestimates for the MBTI are expected to vary not only with \nthe statistical procedures adopted but also with characteris- \ntics of the respondents such as gender and age. Separate reli- \nabilities are reported for these groups of respondents. \n\nAn assumption derived from observations made during \nthe construction of the MBTI instrument is that persons \n\n160 Research \n\nwith a good command ol perception or judgment (i.c., with \ngood type development) are more likely to be clear about \ntheir own preferences. They therefore will report their prel- \nerences more consistently. If these assumptions are correct, \nsamples of older persons should have higher reliability esti- \nmates than samples of younger persons. Since the quality of \nperception and judgment is often evidenced by an individ- \nuals level of achievement, it is expected that in samples \nof persons of comparable age levels, those with higher \nachievement levels will also report their preferences more \nconsistently, and thus these samples will evidence higher \nreliabilities than samples of their lower-achieving peers. \nSince the acquisition of good judgment is postulated to be \nthe most difficult to develop, the TF scale is expected to be \nparticularly vulnerable to deficiencies in type development. \nTherefore, the lowest reliabilities in less effective samples \nare expected to occur on the T-F scale. \n\nThe third topic in this chapter is measurement precision \n(and its converse, error) of the new Form M, an approach \nderived from applying item response theory (IRF; see Chapter \n7 for a full explanation of the theory) to the MBTI. \n\nInternal Consistency \nReliability Estimates \n\nInternal consistency reliability is concerned with how con- \nsistently respondents answer the items on a given scale. The \nmore consistency, the less noise in the measurement. One \nway to examine consistency is to divide the items that com- \npose the scale into parts and then compare the parts with \neach other. This is usually done through various methods of \nsplitting the scale into halves. Because of the unique nature \nof the MBTI, however, it is also possible to examine differ- \nent parts, such as word pairs versus phrase questions. \nAnother way to establish the consistency of the scale is 10 \nuse coefficient alpha to examine how responses to the items \nrelate to one another. \n\nSplit-Half Reliability \n\nOne method of determining the internal consistency relia- \nbility of a scale is to split the item pool into two halves, \ncompute the internal consistency of each half, and correct \nthe result for the length of the scale. This last step is needed \nbecause, at least in the context of classical test theory, \nlonger scales are generally more reliable or consistent. \n\nThe usual procedure for determining which items to \nplace in which half is to use random selection from the total \nset of items on the scale. The characteristics of MBTI items, \nhowever, suggested that the items be split using a logical \nsplit-half procedure. Each Form M scale was split into \nhalves, taking all available item statistics into consideration \nand pairing items that most resemble each other.

Table \n8.3 shows internal consistency reliability coefficients by age \ngroup from the national sample and by cthnic groups derived \n[rom the national sample and from all of the college student \nsamples collected during the revision. It must be remembered \nthat a reliability coefficient is an index of the consistency of \nresponses made by a particular group at a particular time to a \nspecific set of items designed to measure a psychological con- \nstruct. The coefficient is therefore limited by the amount of \nnoise or error that derives from two sources. One source is the \nitems themselves. How items are worded, and how consis- \ntently they, as a set, tap the construct of interest, will affect \nreliability. The other source of noise derives from characteris- \ntics of the individuals themselves. For example, their age or \ndevelopmental level may affect how reliably they respond to \na certain set of items. \n\n162 Research \n\nIn the broad age range available in this sample, there \nappear to be few or no differences in reliabilities across age \ngroups.

It remains to \nbe seen whether such a pattern will be observed with Form \nM; the thcory would predict that this would be the case. \nThe 1985 Manual also suggested that lower reliabilities \nmight be observed in samples of people in midlife. How- \never, as with Form G data reported in the 1985 Manual, \nthere was no evidence to support the hypothesis with Form \nM. The only trend suggested in the Form M age group data \nin Table 8.3 is that the reliability of the J-P scale may \ndecrease slightly in older samples. The trend is slight, how- \never, and should not be overinterpreted. \n\nThe ethnic group data from the adults in Table 8.5 shows \nthat the internal consistency reliabilities for the three ethnic \ngroup samples are comparable to those of the overall \nnational sample, with the possible exception of the T-F \nscale for the African Americans from the national sample, \nwhich is somewhat lower. The college student reliabilities \nshow somewhat lower reliabilities for African Americans on \nthe S-N scale and for Asians or Pacific Islanders on the S-N \nand T-F scales when compared to the reliabilities of the col- \nlege student samples in Table 8.2. \n\nThe 1985 MBTI Manual also shows reliability coeffi- \ncients for Form G for a number of samples that exhibit \ncharacteristics related to development that are presumed by \ntheory to affect how people might self-report their prefer- \nences.

First, intelligence can be scen as a result of \ncffective command of perception and judgment; that is, \nmore information is taken in accurately, and better judg- \nments are made. Second, more intelligent students typi- \ncally have a higher reading level and may have better \nunderstanding of the MBTI vocabulary.

To the degree that these \ncharacteristics are not present in the sample, one should \nexpect lower reliability coefficients. Other than for research \npurposes, the MBTI should not be used routinely with such \ngroups except as a stimulus for discussion. \n\nTest-Retest Reliability Estimates \n\nTest-retest reliability is an estimate of how stable a charac- \nteristic is over time. For the MBTI tool, test-retest reliabili- \nties go beyond the typical computations of correlations for \nthe four continuous scores. Practical questions revolve \naround the likelihood that on retest a person will come out \nthe same MBTI type; that is, a person will choose the same \npole of all four dichotomous domains. \n\nReliabilities in this section include (a) correlations of con- \ntinuous scores, (b) the proportion of cases assigned the same \nletter (direction ol preference) on retest, and (e) the propor- \ntion of cases reporting the same preferences on retest for all \nfour dichotomies (i.e., the same type), three preferenccs, two \npreferences, one preference, or no preferences. \n\nCorrelations of Continuous Scores \n\nBefore introducing Form M data, data are presented from a \ntest-retest study based on an administration of Form J ( John- \nson, 1992). These data, not available for the 1985 MBTI \nManual, are important because of thc long period between \ntest and retest.

The length of time between \ntestings for the Form M data was about one month and \nshould therefore be compared with the Form G &lt;9-month \ninterval. \n\nThe test-retest reliabilities of Form M are generally higher \nthan those of Form G. \n\nFor both forms the reliability coefficient for T-F is the low- \nest of the four scales, especially in the student sample, as \npredicted. \n\nTest-retest reliabilities of continuous scores were also \ncalculated for dilferent ranges of the preference clarity \nindexes (pci) and are shown in Table 8.5. To attain a suffi- \ncient number of people in each range it was necessary to \ncombine all three test-retest samples. In these data there \nwas a clear trend for the stability of the preference clarity \nindexes to be lower for those people whose original pci \nwas low.

The Form G coeffi- \ncients arc from the meta-analysis by R. J. Harvey (1996). \nThe time intervals in the &lt;9-month Form G studies were \nfive to eight weeks, with one sample of eight months. The \nintervals in the &gt;9-month category ranged from nine \nmonths to six years. The time interval for the Form M stud- \nies was four weeks. The agreement across the scales is \nsomewhat higher for Form M, with the T-E scale showing \nthe lowest percentage agrecment on both forms. The high \nagreement in the Consulting Psychologists Press (CPP; \npublisher of the MBTI) sample probably represents an \nupper limit to test-retest reliabilities; most of the individu- \nals in this group were very familiar with type theory and \nhad received an MBTI interpretation prior to the study. \n\nOne of the studies using Form G that was included in \nthe meta-analysis of test-retest studies deserves specific \nmention because it helps answer a question often asked by \nparticipants in workshops. This was a study of the effect of \nmoods on reliabilities conducted by Howes and Carskadon \n(1979), who administered the MBTI instrument to intro- \nductory psychology student volunteers. Mood changes \nwere effected by asking three groups of students to com- \nplete one of three 50-item self-report questionnaires. The \nmood-elevating form contained positive, optimistic self- \nstatements that most people could honestly agree with; the \nmood-depressing form contained negatively worded state- \nments; a neutral form contained bland, nonpersonal attitude \nstatements. A post-treatment measure of mood demon- \nstrated that completing these forms had the intended effect \non mood. The results showed that mood changes did not \nsignificantly affect test-retest MBTI correlations or percent- \nage of agreement on the preference scales.",

At the 50th reunion \nof this class, Katharine Myers (personal communication) \nadministered Form G to 39 of these same people. Over this \n50-year period 8 people (21%) had the same type, 13 (33%) \nhad changed one letter, 16 (41%) had changed two letters, 2 \n(596) had changed three letters, and no one in the group had \nchanged all four letters of his or her type. Over a 50-year \ninterval, then, 5496 changed cither nonc or just one letter. \nThe level of agreement expected by chance would be 6.2596. \nThesc data suggest that personality preferences are fairly sta- \nble over long periods of time but that there are some \nchanges. Also note, however, that any changes over time \nobservable in these data are compounded by changes in both \nthe items and the scoring weights of the instrument itself. \n\nTable 8.7 shows thc percentages of persons reporting \nfour, three, two, one, or no preferences the same on four- \nweek retest. The chance probability of choosing all four \npreferences on retest (1.c., coming out the same type) is \n6.2596. The actual test-retest probabilities are significantly \nhigher than what would be expected by chance. \n\nWhile significant improvements over chance have been \nobserved, the test-retest agreement will never reach 100%, \nOne ot the factors limiting test-retest agreement over time \ntor whole types (i.e., all four letters the same) is that whole \ntypes are arrived at by measuring the four scales separately. \nAs discussed above, responses to the items on cach scale are \nsubject to measurement error and to normal fluctuations in \nthe behavior and characteristics of individuals that may \naffect how they self-report on certain items at certain times. \nWhen these factors are aggregated across the four scales, it \ncreates a ceiling on the achievahle upper limit of agreement \nover time. For example, if we consider the categorical test- \nretest reliabilities of the preference scales for the samples \nshown in Table 8.6 as independent and multiply them \ntogether to arrive at an expectation as to what the agree- \nment for whole types should be over time, the results are \n36%, 63%, and 81% for the three samples. These are very \nclose to the actual figures of 55%, 66%, and 80% for the \n\nsame samples shown in Table 8.7. To achieve test-retest \nagrcement on whole types over time in, say, the high 8096 \nrange, the test-retest reliabilities of the individual scales \nwould all have to be over 9696, which is probably unrealis- \ntic for scales that measure such complex and multifaceted \nconstructs as the MBTI preferences, and as it would be for \nany scale measuring a meaningful psychological construct. \n\nIn conclusion, test-retest reliabilities of the MBTI show \nconsistency over time. When subjects report a change in \ntype, it is most likely to occur in only one preference, and in \nscales where the original preference clarity was low. \n\nMeasurement Precision \nUsing the IRT Method \n\nAs was noted in Chapter 7 on the construction of Form M, \nthe approach to estimating measurement precision that is \ntaken by IRT is in some ways similat tobut in many ways \nquite different fromtraditional CTT-based methods used \nto estimate test rcliability Both IRT and CTT view measure- \nment precision as the relative degree to which test scores \nare frec from undesirable, unsystematic sources of variance; \ntests producing higher levels of precision are viewed as \nbeing more informative regarding each examinees true score \non the underlying psychological characteristic of interest \n(in the present case, the preference clarity indexes on each \nMBTI scale). Both methods likewise define an index that \nprovides a mirror image\" view of precision that is an \ninverse function of the index of measurement precision; \nthis index is the standard error, or SE. Higher standard errors \nare associated with less precise, less informative tests. \n\nIRT and CYT differ fundamentally, however, regarding \nthe concept of how test precision (or error) should be quan- \ntified. In CTT-based approaches, the result is a single esti- \nmate of the tests reliability for a given group, estimated \nusing a technique such as coefficient alpha, or a test-retest \ncorrelation. Estimates based on these techniques were \nreported in the first part of this chapter.",

    "content": "In contrast, IRT methods begin with the assumption that \na single number is not adequate to quantity the precision (or \ndegree of etror) present in a scale. Instead, the measurement \nprecision of a scale is presumed to be able to vary continu- \nously across the possible range of scores (the 0 in IRT termi- \nnology, ot the preference clarity index in the case of the \nMBII). As a consequence, instcad of producing a point- \nestimate of test precision, a scale developed or evaluated \nusing IRT methods provides a graphical function that shows \nthc amount of precision that would be expected at any given \nlevcl of 0. This approach reflects the commonsense notion \nthat scales tend to be more precise for individuals who fall at \nsome levels of 0 and less precise for other individuals. \n\nAs demonstrated in Chapter 7, this was exactly the goal \nthat Myers set in constructing the MBTI scales.

She was not interested in \ndifferentiating between people who demonstrated, for \nexample, a clear versus a very clear preference for Extraver- \nsion. Instead, the goal was to make sure, to the extent possi- \nble, that people with slight preferences on each side of the \nmidpoint were classified accurately. IRT approaches to pre- \ncision provide a means to describe and evaluate the preci- \nsion or error at precisely this point. \n\nCTT-based indexes of measurement precision (i.e., relia- \nbility coefficients) will typically be unable to quantify or \ndetect such phenomena. Although it would be possible to \ncalculate reliability coefficients for subgroups of individuals \nrepresenting different degrees of clarity of preference, the \nmost commonly encountered CTT-based estimates of an \ninstruments precision simply provide an overall, aggregate \nestimate of the instruments precision across the entire \nrange of scale scores. Unfortunately, this global estimate of \nreliability is likely to overestimate measurement precision \nat the extremes and underestimate precision in the middle \nrange of scores. Myers was well aware of this limitation of \ntraditional reliability coefficients. Her attempt to overcome \nthis deficiency, and to provide information about precision \nat the center of the scales, led her to use two kinds of cate- \ngorical coefficients for estimating reliability, phi and tetra- \nchoric, which are used with variables that represent true or \nartificial dichotomies, respectively. Because phi was believed \nto overstate the reliability of the type categories and tetra- \nchoric to understate the reliability, she was attempting to \nbracket the true reliability. Fortunately, the use of IRT \ntechniques provides a more direct solution to the problem. \n\nThe IRT equivalent of the CTT reliability coefficient is \nthe test information function (TIF), which shows the amount \nof precision produced by the test at each possible value of 0; \nthe IRT equivalent of the standard error of measurement \n(SEM) is the test standard error (TSE) lunction, which \nshows the expected SE that would be found when estimat- \ning 0 scores from the observed item responses across the \nfull range of possible 0 scores. These functions can be \ngraphed, showing clearly how precision and error vary for \ndifferent scores on the scale. \n\nFigures 8.1-8.4 present the IRT-based TIFs and TSE \nfunctions for the Form M item pools (solid line); the corre- \nsponding values for the Form G item pools (broken line) \nare provided in each plot for comparison purposes. As the \nresults clearly demonstrate, the IRT assumption that test \nprecision varies as a function of the particular range of test \nscores being considered is quite evident. Furthermore, mea- \nsurement precision tends to be at its highest in the vicinity \nof the midpoint of each seale, exactly as would be desired \nfor an instrument used to determine dichotomous prefer- \nences. Test information functions such as seen in these fig- \nures are the result of selecting items like those shown in \nFigure 7.2 in Chapter 7, that is, items that demonstrate \nsteep slopes around the midpoint of the scale. \n\n\"HA p UW MOL \nfor the Form G versus M item pools.

Thus, even if the reductions in the SE of estimat- \ning 0 scores near the cutoff point are relatively modest, \npotentially important improvements in test-retest categori- \ncal type stabilityas well as best-fit type agreement rates \nmay be achieved as a result of the improved measurement \nseen in the Form M item pools. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe internal consistency of the four MBTI scales is quite \nhigh in all samples available to date, whether computed \nusing logical split-half, consecutive item split-half, or cocf- \nficient alpha. There has been a substantial improvement in \nForm M reliabilities over those of Form G, at least in the \nsamples collected so far. \n\nA summary of the Form G data suggests, however, that \nsample characteristics, particularly those related to type \ndevelopment, may result in variation in reliabilities across \ngroups. Groups composed of people who are believed to \nhave less command over perception and judgment should \nexhibit lower reliabilities. \n\nTest-retest reliabilities of the MBTI show consistency \nover time, with levels of agreement much greater than by \nchance. When subjects report a change in type, it is most \nlikely to occur in only one preference, and in scales where \nthe original preference clarity was low. The test-retest relia- \nbilities of Form M are improved over those of Form G. The \nreliability coefficient for T-F remains the lowest of the four \nscales, as expected. \n\nA new method for estimating measurement precision is \navailable with the use of IRT. This method is based on calcu- \nlating the amount of information that is available [rom each \nitem that can be used to discriminate people of opposite pref- \nerences. The precision of all scales is greater for Form M. \n\nAA  f \nP i A \n\n\"7. . \" ul a - -g&gt; A M \nAlso of interest is the comparison of the height f the TIFs \n\n166 Research \n\n| Theta \n\n    - o 2 \nWw hb OHA IO OO \n\nITEMS m= ma FormG emm Form M \n\n hh \n\no0 \n \n* \n@ \nB \na \na \ne \n\nE \n\"a \n\"uu; \n\nQ  MN Ww .

The theory suggests that persons are, or \nbecome, different types, and the MBTI attempts to classify \npersons according to the type that they believe best fits \nthem. The theory postulates that the basic preferences for \nSensing or Intuitive perception lead to different interests \nand that basic preferences for Thinking or Feeling judg- \nment lead to differences in acting on those interests.

If Jung's \ntheory describes preferences that do exist, and if the MBTI \nadequately indicates those preferences, then surface behav- \niors should be in the directions predicted by the theory, \nwith allowances, of course, for measurement error in the \ninstrument, stage of development of the person, and over- \nriding environmental pressures that interfere with expres- \n\nsion of type preferences. \n\n171 \n\n172 Research \n\nThere are two broad categories of evidence that can be \nbrought to bear on the issuc of the validity of MBTI results. \nThe first category includes evidence for the validity of the sep- \narate preference scales that compose the Indicator. This is the \nlevel at which measurement takes place with the MBTI. Since \nthe separate preferences are the component parts needed to \nachieve the goal of helping people identity a whole type, it is \nimportant to establish the validity of the separate scales. Evi- \ndence falling into this category includes the following: \n\nB Factor analysis of MBTI item pools \n\n8 Correlations of MBTI continuous scores for each scale \nwith scores from the scales of other instruments \n\nB Categorical analysis of behaviors believed to be associ- \nated with people of different preferences \n\nB Analyses designed to uncover dichotomies \n\nB Analysis of brain activity patterns \n\nThe second category of evidence concerns the validity of \nwhole types or of particular combinations of preferences, \nparticularly those combinations that have theoretical \nimportance. The primary goal in using the Indicator is to \nhelp a person arrive at a complete four-letter type. It is \ntherefore important to show that each of the 16 types has \nunique characteristics and that these characteristics are not \nentirely predictable from knowledge of the separate prefer- \nences. According to type theory, there are dynamic relations \namong the functions and attitudes that make up a persons \ntype that suggest characteristics or behaviors that may not \nbe apparent at a preference-scale level of analysis. Predic- \ntions can be made and tested based on the persons domi- \nnant and auxiliary functions and the functions that the per- \nson extraverts and introverts. \n\nThe evidence for this category includes the following: \n\nComparison of MBTI reported type with best-fit type \nAnalysis of type distributions \n\nAnalysis based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) \nObservations by independent raters \n\nAnalyses involving whole types as the unit of analysis, \nincluding attraction and satisfaction in couples, rebellious- \nness and distress in veterans, and type and time orientation \n8 (Comparisons with factor scores derived from other \nmeasures \n\nThe application chapters that follow in this manual also \ncontain a wealth of data and analyses that are relevant to the \nvalidity of the MBTI at both levelspreferences and whole \ntypes. These topics will not be repeated here. \n\nValidity of the Four Preference Scales \n\nFactor Analyses \n\nThe factor structure of MBTI item pools provides evidence \nol the construct validity of the MBTI assessment tool. When \ncxamining factor analytic studies it is important to select an \n\nitem pool that is appropriate for the question being asked. If \nthe research question involves the four preference scales, \nthen the items of interest are only those items that are used \nto score the four preference scales of the MBTI. These are \nthe 94 items that constitute the Form G or Form F scoring \nor the 93 items that are used in the new Form M scoring. \nWith the exception of the Form G self-scorable and the new \nForm M, other forms of the MBTI (i.e., Forms G, K, and J) \ncontain research items, or items used to score for subscales, \nor both. If these additional items are unwittingly included, \nas they have been, in a factor analysis designed to test the \nfour-factor structure of the MBTI, the results will, not sur- \nprisingly, be other than predicted, as more than four factors \narc likely to emerge. \n\nOnce the appropriate set of items has been selected, the \nappropriate factor analytic tool must also be used. Two \nbasic kinds of factor analytic studies can be performed: ex- \nploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Exploratory fac- \ntor analysis is the most widely used, although it provides \nonly limited information about a hypothesized factor struc- \nture of a set of items. Although very useful for the purpose \nof developing hypotheses with respect to the factor struc- \nture of an instrument, exploratory factor analysis is not par- \nticularly useful in testing the degree to which an already \nhypothesized structure fits the observed data. Since with \nthe MBTI there is a clearly hypothesized structure based on \ntheorythe four-factor model that represents the four pref- \nerence scalesconfirmatory studies will yield more infor- \nmation about the construct validity of the MBTI.

    "content": "cussion of these two kinds of factor analyses below relies on \nthe review by Harvey (1996). \n\nExploratory Factor Analyses In an exploratory factor \n\nanalysis of the MBTI, basically two possible outcomes can \noccur. First, the exploratory analysis can produce a factor \nstructure that appears to be similar to the hypothesized \nstructure. However, because the exploratory factor model is \nunrestricted in a statistical sense, an infinite number of \nother equally well-fitting models can also exist that would \nprovide an equally plausible fit to the data. Second, the \nexploratory analysis could instead produce a factor \nstructure that is different from the predicted structure (e.g., \nit may contain a different number of factors, or the items \nmay not load on the factors in the predicted fashion). \n\nSeveral exploratory studies of the MBTI have produced \nresults that are virtually identical to the hypothesized four- \nfactor model: e.g., Harvey, Murry, and Stamoulis (1995); \nThompson and Borrello (1986); Tzeng, Outcalt, Boyer, \nWare, and Landis (1984). Tischler (1994), analyzing a large \nsample, found *unusually strong evidence that MBTI items \nare correlated with (measure) their intended scales; the \nscales are almost factorially pure (p. 30). \n\nThere have also been two instances reported in the liter- \nature where the predicted factor structure was not obtained: \nComrey (1983) and Sipps, Alexander, and Friedt (1985). \nBoth of these studies can be questioned regarding one or \n\nmore of the decisions made when conducting their analyses \n(e.g., retaining factors based on questionable criteria; forc- \ning an orthogonal rotation on the data; using samples with \nvery low ratios of subjects to items; using the principal \ncomponents model when it is obvious that MBTI items con- \ntain considerable levels of unique variance). The factor \nstructures that emerged from both these studies were tested \nagainst the predicted four-factor structure using the more \nrigorous confirmatory approach, which is discussed in the \nfollowing section. \n\nConfirmatory Factor Analyses Confirmatory factor \nanalysis (e.g., James, Mulaik, &amp; Brett, 1982; Jreskog &amp; \nSrbom, 1981) is able to provide a much more definitive \ntest of the plausibility of a hypothesized factor structure \nthan is the exploratory approach. In a confirmatory factor \nanalysis a specific structural model is fitted to the data. If a \nmodel fits poorly, then the hypothesized factor structure is \ndisconfirmed. However, as with any model-testing method, \neven if the hypothesized model fits well, such a finding does \nnot prove that the hypothesized model is correct. There \nmay be other models, not vet tested or even thought ol, that \ndemonstrate a similar or even better goodness of fit. \nConsequently, confirmatory techniques are most powerful \nwhen they are used to compare the performance of \ncompeting models. \n\nSeveral confirmatory factor analyses have been con- \nducted on the MBTI. Johnson and Saunders (1990) analyzed \nthe subscales produced by the Step I] scoring system of \nForm J. The results indicated clear support for the plausibil- \nity of the predicted hierarchical structure of the instrument \n(i.e., the subscale-to-overall-preference-scale relationships). \n\nThompson and Borrello (1989) evaluated the fit of the \nhypothesized four-factor model, concluding that it fit well \nin their sample. Neither these researchers nor Johnson and \nSaunders, however, tested any competing models against \nwhich the reported levels of fit could be compared. \n\nHarvey et al. (1995) did test three competing views of \nthe latent structure of the MBTI. The three models were the \npredicted four-factor model and the two five-factor models \ndeveloped by Sipps et al. (1985) and Comrey (1983) in \ntheir exploratory factor analyses. The results of the Harvey \net al. (1995) study provided strong support for the validity \nof the predicted four-factor model. In contrast, the Sipps et \nal. and Comrey five-factor models both exhibited severe \nflaws that suggested that they were fundamentally misspec- \nifed (e.g., factor correlations approaching 1.0). \n\nA confirmatory factor analysis was also conducted on \nForm M, using the data from the national sample (N = 3,036; \nsee Chapter 7 for the characteristics of this sample). The \nsoftware package PRELIS 2 was used to obtain polychoric \ncorrelations and asymptotic variance matrices suitable for \ndichotomous items. The matrices were used by LISREL \n8.12 software running the diagonal weighted least squares \nprocedure to estimate the model (Jreskog &amp; Srbom, \n1981). Also, because the S-N and J-P scales are known to \n\nValidity 173 \n\ncorrelate, the latent variables were allowed to correlate. The \nadjusted goodness of fit was .949 and the nonnormed fit \nindex was .967. The median of the fitted residuals was \n~.008. These results indicate an excellent fit to the four- \nfactor model. \n\nIn sum, when the exploratory and confirmatory factor",

Several large-sample, \ncarefully conducted exploratory studies produced text- \nbook\" four-factor structures that almost exactly matched the \nhypothesized pattern of loadings (Harvey, 1996). Of even \ngreater importance, several confirmatory studies of both \nForm G and Form M have unanimously supported the \nvalidity of the hypothesized factor structure and in one case \nconclusively rejected the competing models proposed by \nSipps et al. (1985) and Comrey (1983). Although additional \nconfirmatory studies need to be conducted to demonstrate \nthe generalizability of the above findings, there is no ques- \ntion that the results of the factor analytic studies reported \nover the past 10-year period have been very supportive of \nthe validity of the four-scale structure of the MBTI. \n\nCorrelation of MBTI Continuous Scores \nwith Other Scales \n\nA series of tables in this section summarize representative \ncorrelations from many different samples with a wide vari- \nety of instruments. One set of tables shows correlations \nbased on Form G, while the other set is bascd on Form M. \nMany additional correlations for Form G are found in the \n1985 MBTI Manual (Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985). Some of \nthe Form G correlations found in the 1985 MBTI Manual \nare repeated here because of their relevance to the construct \nvalidity of the preference scales. Correlations with Form G \nthat were not available for the 1985 Manual are presented \nhere for the same reason. \n\nIn all of these tables, the left-hand columns show the \nactual product moment correlations of MBTI continuous \nscores with scales of other tests. Those tables that display \nForm G correlations use the continuous scores based on \nplacing preference scores on a continuum, as described in \nthe 1985 Manual. Those tables that display Form M correla- \ntions use theta as the MBTI score. (See Chapter 7 for a defi- \nnition of theta.) \n\nTo make it easier to identify correlates of each prefer- \nence, the right-hand column in each table designates the \nletters for preferences where correlations are at least .20 and \nsignificant at probabilities of .05 or greater. The .20 cutoff is \nused simply as a convention, so that by scanning the right- \nhand columns the reader can quickly identify characteris- \ntics associated with each preference and can judge whether \nthese charactcristics make sense in light of the expectations \nof the theory. This has bcen carried over from the 1985 \nManual fot the sake of consistency. However, the use of this \nconvention means that there arc statistically significant cor- \nrelations shown in the main body of the table that are not \n\n174 Research \n\nflagged in the right-hand column because they were .20. \nAlthough small, trends in such correlations may be theoret- \nically as well as statistically significant, and readers are \nurged to seek these out. For theoretical purposes the direc- \ntion and trend of the correlations for a given preference \nscale across a variety of scales and samples is more impor- \ntant than the significance or absolute level of one correla- \ntion coefficient in one sample for one scale. \n\nNote that a correlation of at least .20 indicates that at \nleast +% of the variance is shared among the two variables \nbeing correlated. While this may seem like a small portion \nof variance to those accustomed to evaluating reliability \ncoefficients, it should be noted that these correlations are \nvalidity coefficients, which in the behavioral sciences are \ntypically much lower. According to Cohen (1988), correla- \ntions between variables in personality and social psychol- \nogy are considered large if they are about r = .5, which \naccounts for only 2596 of the shared variance. Correlations \nof .20 are considered small- to medium-sized effects (Cohen, \n1988), which are quite common and meaningful. \n\nNote also that the correlations reported in this chapter \nare raw (uncorrected) coefficients that may underestimate \nthe true relationship between the latent variables. None of \nthese correlations has been corrected for attenuation or \nrestriction of range. Coefficients that are corrected for \nattenuation will be higher because the correction takes into \naccount the less than perfect reliability of the two measures \ninvolved. Most of the reliability coefficients for the prefer- \nence scales on Form M are in the .90 range (see Chapter 8) \nand thus require little correction. Many of the reliability \ncoefficients of the other variables that are displayed in the \ntables in this chapter are unknown. Given that many of \nthese scales were created only for research purposes or have \nnot been subjected to extensive development, however, it is \nsafe to say that their reliabilities are lower. If these reliabili- \nties were around .60, then the corrected r = .20 correlations \nwould be around r = .27. Similarly, if the samples used to",

    "content": "compute the correlations were restricted in range (i.e., they \nwere relatively homogeneous on the MBTI scale or the \nother scale), this would also result in lower correlations. \n\nAnother point to consider when examining these tables: \nFor the purposes of the theory it is just as important that cer- \ntain correlations are not significant as that other correlations \nare in the expected directions. For example, Extraversion \nshould be positively correlated with measures of sociability; \nThinking should not. The flagged correlation then may not \nbe the most important one for a given hypothesis. For some \ninvestigations, overall patterns (both size and direction) \nmay he important, and some of these will be noted below. In \naddition, a lack of a correlation may be meaningful. \n\nThe conventional notation for MBTI correlations, using \nMBTI continuous scores or thetas, is followed, such that \npositive correlations are associated with I, N, E or P, and \nnegative correlations with E, S, T, or J. However, this con- \nvention does not apply to either Table 9.1 or Table 9.2 \nbecause the rescarchers who conducted these studies used \n\nMBTI preference scores, not continuous scores. In these \ntables positive correlations are associated with higher scores \non the preference at the top of each column. \n\nCorrelations of MBTI continuous scores have their limi- \ntations as evidence for construct validity. They report only \nthe four preference scales one at a time and do not show the \n16 types as dynamic entities. Correlations also have the \nproblem of confounding direction and clarity of preference. \n\nUnless otherwise noted, high scores in the scales reflect \nthe concept named by the author of the scale. For example, \nif a scale named Spontaneity correlates with Perceiving, \nhigh scores for spontaneity would be associated with high \nscores on J-P and there would be a P in the right-hand col- \numn. Not mentioned in the table but implicit in correlations \nis the fact that when high spontaneity is associated with Per- \nceiving, low spontaneity is associated with Judging, since \nJ-P is a bipolar scale. Similarly, when a scale is highly associ- \nated with Judging, there will be a negative correlation in the \nJ-P column and a ) in the right-hand column. \n\nCorrclations of various instruments thought to be rele- \nvant to establishing the validitiy of the MBTI preference \nscales are found in the tables in this chapter. Tables 9.1 \nthrough 9.6 display correlations of the MBTI with other \npersonality instruments. \n\nTable 9.7 shows correlations of the Form M preferences \nwith the General Occupational Themes, the Basic Interest \nScates, and the Personal Style Scales of the Strong Interest \nInventory. The Occupational Scales (OS) are not shown here \nfor space reasons. However, for correlations of Form G with \nthe OS see Hammer and Kummerow (1996). Table 9.8 \nshows correlations with two additional career-related \ninventories, the Career Factors Inventory (Chartrand, Rob- \nbins, &amp; Morrill, 1997) and the Strong Shills Confidence \nInventory (Betz, Borgen, &amp; Harmon, 1996). \n\nTable 9.9 shows correlations between MBTI continuous \nscores and scales from two inventories that measure values. \nTable 9.10 shows correlations of real and ideal work environ- \nments based on the Work Environment Scale. Table 9.11 \nshows correlations with three measures of stress and coping: \nthe Maslach Burnout Inventory, the Coping Resources Inven- \ntory, and the State-Trait Anxicty Inventory. \n\nExtraversion In type theory, Extraversion is an outward \nattitude in which energy flows toward the environment. \nIhis outward turning is manifested in different ways, \nincluding the following: \n\nB Extraversion as measured by other instruments: the 16 \nPersonality Factors? Questionnaire (16PF), Millon Index \nof Personality Styles\", NEO-PI, and Jungian Type Survey \n\nB Sense of comfort in the environment, which is shown in \nmeasures named selt-acceptance, well-being, autonomy, \nself-confidence, and stability \n\nB Action on the environment, as shown in correlations with \ndominance, assertiveness, social boldness, capacity for \nstatus, leadership, change, aggression, and exhibition \n\nValidity  175 \nTable 9.1 Correlation of MBT!

In the \nJudging attitude a decision is made relatively quickly; in the \nPerceiving attitude perception continues longer, options are \nkept open, and adaptability to a changing situation is pre- \nferred over following a goal-directed plan. \n\nIn theory, characteristics associated with a preference for \nthe Judging attitude are decisiveness, desire for control, \norder, dependability, and conscientiousness. When Judging \nis not balanced adequately by Perceiving, Judging may be \ncorrelated with prejudice or closed-mindedness. Correla- \ntions include the following: \n\nB Attempt to create order in the environment as shown in cor- \nrelations with scales such as systematizing, perfection- \nism, and control \n\nW Respect for societal mores as shown in relationships with \nscales such as order, conforming, rule consciousness, \nconscientiousness, responsibility, socialization, good \n\nimpression, self-control, endurance, achievement via \nconformity, and valuing economic security \n\nB Career interests in the conventional area and in data \nmanagement and office services activities \n\nThe Perceiving Attitude Type theory predicts that the \nPerceiving attitude will be associated with spontaneity, \nadaptability, curiosity, and openness to new ideas. If not \nbalanced by Judging, Perceiving may be correlated with \nundependability. Constructs related to Perceiving include \nthe following: \n\n8 Openness to the environment, as shown by relationships \nwith measures of innovation (the opposite of systematiz- \ning on the Millon Index of Personality Styles), openness to \nchange, abstractedness, openness, flexibility, variety, cre- \nativity, change, free child, autonomy, risk taking, and \nvaluing studying \n\nB Career interests in the artistic area and interest in activi- \nties related to nature, music/dramatics, art, applied arts, \nand writing \n\n184 .

Corrclations \nfrom three different studies are shown in Table 9.12. The \nsample at the top of the table (Karesh, Pieper, &amp; Holland, \n1994) correlated JTS preference scores with MBTI Form G \ncontinuous scores. The two samples at the bottom of the \ntable are from the 1985 MBTI Manual. The JTS has no scale \ncomparable to J-P. \n\nDespite the relatively positive correlations for the prefer- \nences individually, Grant (1965) reported that only 2196 of \n159 Auburn University students came out the same type on \nboth instruments. Rich (1972) also compared thc MBTI \nand the 15th edition of the JTS on a sample of 98 evening \ndivision students in a course on Jung offered at the Univer- \nsity of Minnesota. Continuous scores were not used for the \nanalyses; instead, correlations were reported for the sums of \nMBII points and the JTS scores. The correlations between \nthe two instruments were E .68 (p &lt; .01), 1.66 (p &lt; .01), S \n3 (p= 01), N A17 p.  015. T 3395 ROP and PE \n05). The two instruments appear to be tapping the same \nconstructs. \n\nEvidence for Dichotomies \n\nJungian theory posits the existence of dichotomies. A \npromising technique for showing evidence of dichotomies \nis to plot the means of a dependent variable upon both \npoles of a preference scale. A dichotomy should show a \ndivision point where there is a change in slope or level, or \nsome other disparity, between the two poles of the scale. If \npossible, the dependent variable should be onc in which the \ntwo categories of people behave quite differently, even with \nthe barest difference in their scores. It is not easy to identify",

If \nthe plots are found to show unusual characteristics that can \nbest be explained as reflecting a dichotomy, then both the \ntheory and the validity of the MBTI would be supported. \nThe conditions for these analyses are as follows: \n\nI. The basic trend for cach half of the distribution should be \nclearly evident. The trend should be a function of the \nrelationship between the MBTI preference and the \nother construct and not a function of the particular \nsample. Samples of several thousand can, of course, \nbe more finely divided and still yield a stable picture \nof the distribution slope and level. This provides \nsome insurance against chance variation due to sam- \npling or measurement error. Also, stability is more \nessential than detail; it is more important to identify \nthe overall stable trend in the data than to focus on \nhow the preference scale should be divided. \n\n2. Any disparity between the halves should not be \n\"smoothed.\" No a priori assumption of a continuum \nshould be imposed on the data by connecting the two \nhalves. Each half of the distribution should be \nallowed to start at zero as though the other did not \nexist. The trend of each half can then be determined \nindependently. \n\n3. A reversal in direction is evidence for dichotomy. The \nclearest kind of disparity in slope is a reversal of \n\nValidity 185 \n\ndirection, for example, a V-shaped or U-shaped linc. \nAccording to the Jungian hypothesis, each distrihu- \ntion should divide the population into two categories. \nThe slope of the line within each category should \nreflect the effect of differing clarities of preference. \nBecause the two populations are hypothesized, there \nis no obligation to harmonize or connect the slopes or \nlines of the two categories. Between categories, there- \nfore, there can be disparity in any combination of \nslope, level, and direction. \n\nExamples of U-Shaped Distribution Plots A series of \nanalyses were made of a sample of 5,025 male Pennsylvania \nhigh school students and a sample of 720 male Mas- \nsachusetts high school students. Each analysis contained \nsix sample groups based on the size of the preference scores \n(1-17, 19-35, and 37+ on each side of the midpoint). In the \nPennsylvania sample, mean IQ scores were computed for \neach preference score grouping; for the Massachusetts \nsample, vocabulary scores were used. \n\nFigure 9.1 shows the mean intelligence scores for the \nmale Pennsylvania high school students, divided into six \ngroups of the preference scores for each of the dichotomies, \nand the mean vocabulary scores for the Massachusetts high \nschool students for the same six groupings for each of the \nfour MBTI scales. \n\nBoth the E-1 and J-P dichotomies show a trend for \nclearer preferences (away from the midpoint) to be associ- \nated with higher scores. The Perceiving side of the scale is \nalso higher than the Judging side of the scale, which is typi- \ncal for J-P plots on aptitude/achievement data. \n\nClear preferences on either Thinking or Feeling are asso- \nciated with higher scores on both IQ and vocabulary mea-",

The curve shows greater discrepancy for clear and \nunclear (near the midpoint) preferences than the curves for \nE-I and J-P \n\nThe plots for the S-N scale show that this scale does not \noperate the same on intelligence and vocabulary as do the \nother scales. Rather than clearer preferences in either pole \nleading to higher IQ and vocabulary scores, only clearer \npreferences for Intuition lead to greater scores. This also \ndemonstrates why it is important to choose a variable for \neach scale that is theoretically appropriate. \n\nExamples of Discontinuities If Jung was correct about \ndichotomous populations, and if the MBTI correctly \nseparates the two populations on each prelerence scale, then \na discontinuity around the midpoint of the scale is expected. \nIn order to constitute a discontinuity, there must be  \nsignificantly greater rate of change at the point of dis- \ncontinuity than on either side of that point. lt is not sufficient \nto show that the difference in means or proportions between \nall contiguous intervals is significant; what is important is \nevidence for a change in slope or direction somewhere near \nthe hypothesized midpoint of the scale. \n\n156 \n\nMean IQ \n\nMean IQ \n\nMean IQ \n\nMean IQ \n\nResearch \n\n125 \n\n120 \n\nIIS \n\n110 r \n\nIOS \n36 18 O 18 36 \nE Scores | Scores \n\nIp o \n\n120 \n\n115 \n\n110 4 \n\n10S \n36 18 0 18 36 \nS Scores N Scores \n\n125 \n\n120 \n\nTE \n\n110 \n\n105 . \n36 18 O0 18 36 \nT Scores F Scores \n\n125 \n120 \nlS D m \n110 a \n105 \n30 BLOGO OA \nJ Scores P Scores \n\nVocabulary \n\nVocabulary \n\nVocabulary \n\nVocabulary \n\n19 \n17 \nI5 \n13 \nEN \nr  \n9 \n36 8 30 I8 36 \nE Scores | Scores \n19 \ny \nI5 \n13 \n1 | GEN \n9 \n36 fae) 0 187 36 \nS Scores N Scores \n19 \n17 \nIS \n13 \nii \n9 \n30g 0E 1 82545 \nT Scores F Scores \n17 \nIS \n\n; pes \n\n3G EINE \n\nJ Scores \n\nI8 36 \n\nP Scores \n\nFigure 9.1 Mean Aptitude Scores at Different Levels of Preference Scores for Each of the Dichotomies \nNote: Mean intelligence scores are for the male Pennsylvania high school students; mean vocabulary scores are for the Massachusetts high school students. \n\nProportion of Engineers \n\n48 36 24 12 0 12 24 \n\nT Scores \n\nValidity 187 \n\n36 48 \n\nF Scores \n\nFigure 9.2 Proportion of Engineering Students Who Reported Different Levels of Preference on the T-F Dichotomy \n\nOne needs, therefore, evidence for a not-too-steep slope \nwith a significant break at the division point. Because proba- \nbilities are influenced by the size of samples, to demonstrate \nthat such a break is significant either the sample must be so \nlarge that even a modest discontinuity is significant or the \ndiscontinuity must be so large that it is significant even for a \nmodest sample. Each of these alternatives is demonstrated. \n\nEngineering Students and the T-F Scale A comparison of \nliberal arts and engineering students on thc TF scale is an \nexample of a small difference observable in a large sample \nand is shown in Figure 9.2. One conspicuous contrast on \nthe T-F scale is between a sample of 2,389 engineering stu- \ndents and 2,177 liberal arts students tested as part of the \nanalyses for Form E Sixty-eight percent of engineering stu- \ndents preferred Thinking, compared with only 54% of lib- \neral arts students. The liberal arts and engineering samples \nwere combined, making a total sample of 4,566. The pro- \nportion of engineers was computed for each 12-point inter- \nval along the T-F scale, running both directions from zero. \nIf the tendency to choose an engineering college is linked \nto a preference for Thinking or Feeling, then a discontinuity \n\nin the slope should occur at the division point. If the choice \nof engineering is related only to the clarity of the Thinking or \nFeeling preference, then the slope should be unbroken. In \nthe analysis of the combined sample, each half of the scale \nwas divided into five intervals of preference scores (1-11, \n1323, 2535, 37-47, 49+). A t-test was used to test for dil- \nferences between intervals. Of the nine successive differences \nbetween adjacent intervals, only the one that fell at the divi- \nsion point was statistically significant (t = 3.25, p &lt; .001). The \nbroken line in Figure 9.2 shows the disparity between the \nsteepness at the division point compared to the more gradual \nslope in the two halves of the distribution. Table 9.13 shows \nthe t-value for the difference between cach successive inter- \nval and the significant p-value at the midpoint. \n\nFaculty Ratings of Gregariousness and E-I Preference A com- \nparison of Extraverts and Introverts in gregariousness is \nan example of a large difference in a modest sample and is \nshown in Figure 9.3.

    "content": "Figure 9.3 Faculty Ratings of Gregariousness in Students Who Reported Different Levels of Preference on the E-I Dichotomy \n\nMBTI results. Ross reported correlations of .50 between the \nE-! scale and gregariousness on a Solitary-Gregarious \nscale. The sample was a composite of students in four col- \nleges. The subsample of 249 cases shown in Figure 9.3 had \na correlation between Extraversion and gregariousness of \n42. When Extraverts were correlated independently of \nIntroverts, the correlation was only .05. The Introvert corre- \nlation independent of Extraverts was  21. Figure 9.3 indi- \ncates that the faculty considered gregariousness a general \ncharacteristic of Extraverts, and it was not related to the \ndegree of Extraversion. Introverts of any degree are seen as \nclearly less gregarious than Extraverts; in addition, Intro- \nverts having the clearest prelerence for Introversion on thc \nMBTI were seen as the least gregarious. \n\nAs can be seen in the figure and in Table 9.13, the only \nsignificant change between contiguous intervals occurred \nbetween the ranges E 1-11 and I 1-11 (t = 2.80, p &lt; .01). The \nchange at or near zero is significantly greater than changes \nbetween any other positions on the E-I scale. These data \nsupport both the existence of a dichotomy on the E-I scale \nard the correctness of the location of its division point. \n\nPreference for Reading and Differences on the S-N Scale \nA comparison of number of books reported read by Sensing \nand Intuitive types is another example of a large difference in \na modest sample. Hicks (1984) described reports of Sensing \ntypes and Intuitive types on the number of books reported \nbeing read in the past year. Figure 9.4 shows the mean num- \nber of books reported being read for persons with different \n\nlevels of preference for Sensing or Intuition. The largest dil- \nference appears at the midpoint; the clearer the preference \nfor Intuition, the more books are reported being read. \n\nEvidence for Dichotomies in Brain Activity Patterns \nJung, Briggs, and Myers viewed type preferences as inborn \ndispositions to develop along specific lines. Type may thus \nbe viewed as a basic template that directs and organizes life \nexperiences and contributes to dilferential responses to \nsimilar life events. Jung saw personality as biologically based \nand concluded that type antithesis must have some kind of \nbiological foundation as well (Jung, 1921/1971). Current \nmethods such as topographic brain mapping and EEG \nrecordings offer hope of uncovering these relationships. \nDifferences betwcen Extraverts and Introverts have been \nstudied by a number of researchers. Wilson and Languis \n(1989) discuss an approach to construct validation that \ninvolves an attempt to \"establish a link between neurocogni- \ntive psychophysiological data and psychological type data \nthrough the investigation of differences in brain electrical \nactivity patterns . . . (p. 14). Their first study involved a \ncomparison of those identified by the MBTI as having an \nExtraverted preference versus those with an Introverted prel- \nerence. To control for other aspects of type, all other prefer- \nences were the same (NTP). Topographic brain mapping data \nwere collected using a protocol based on standard measure- \nment of cottical activity. The research literature on personal- \nity differences was used to construct cognitive tasks that were \nadministered during the measurement of evoked potentials. \n\nTable 9.13 \n\nInterval l 2 3 \n\nEngineering Study \n\n(Figure 9.2) \n\nt 1.4 1.29 0.74 \np \n\nGregariousness Study \n(Figure 9.3) \n\nt 0.20 0.64 0.88 \np \n\nValidiy 189 \n\nt-Values and Significance Between Intervals for Plots Shown in Figures 9.2 and 9.3 \n\n|.28 2229 1.55 |.08 0.89 0.69 \n\n0.00 | \n\n2.80 0.25 0.64 \n0.01 \n\n0.104 0.27 \n\nA comparison of the Extraverts and Introverts is shown in \nFigure 9.5. Significant and consistent differences were found \nacross a number of tests between the Extraverts and Intro- \nverts, suggesting that Extraverts demonstrate less cortical \narousal than do Introverts. The authors hypothesize that the \nrelatively greater cortical arousal of Introverts leads to their \nseeking to reduce stimulation from the environment; the \nauthors plan to follow up with larger samples and samples \nof different preferences. \n\nIn other research, Stenbergs (1990) studies of blood flow \nshow higher activity in anterior temporal lobes for Intro- \nverts, which may be related to Extraverts being geared to \nrespond and seek excitement in order to avoid underarousal; \nin contrast, Introverts, who are geared to inspect, may be \nthreatened by overarousal and seek out peaceful pursuits in \nsolitude and tranquility.

The \ndata below that are not included in these publications were \nmade available by IPAR for this manual. \n\nThe IPAR samples of creative people were selected by \npeer nomination from professions judged to be creative; \nthus they represent highly creative people in creative fields. \nlt is useful, therefore, to compare the type distributions of \nhighly creative people with one another, with samples of \nothers in creative fields, and with the distribution of types \nin the general public. \n\nTable 9.15 shows correlations between the MBTI and the \nKirton Adaption and Innovation Inventory (KAI; Kirton, \n1987) in two samples (Fleenor, 1997; Gryskiewicz &amp; \nTullar, 1995). The correlations of the MBTI SN and J-P \nscales with the total KAI score are similar and demonstrate \na relationship between Intuition and Perceiving and the \ninnovation (or, conversely, between Sensing and Judging \nand the adaptation) style of creativity. The opposite sign of \nthe E-1 correlation in the two studies is curious, with sam- \npling error being the most likely explanation, given the dis- \nparity in the sample sizes in the two studies. \n\nValidity 191 \n\nType distributions of samples of creative people show \ntheir preference for Intuition. The field in which they work \nmakes little difference, although writers tend to be NF and \nmathematicians and scientists tend to be NT. To be appreci- \nated, the percentage of Intuitive types among creative indi- \nviduals should be seen in perspective. The frequency of \nIntuitive types in the general population is roughly esti- \nmated at 25%. In the creative samples, all but three of the \nhighly creative men in the four IPAR samples preferred \nIntuition. Comparison of this distribution with that of the \nselected college population yields a chi-square statistic of \nmore than 50.00, an occurrence that could happen by \nchance less than one in a million times. \n\nIf Intuition is a key factor in creativity, as theory would \npredict, then groups rated at different levels of crcativity \nshould also differ in the proportion of Intuitive types. In Hall \nand MacKinnons (1969) data, architects in the first group \nwere judged by other architects to be highly creative. Those \nin the second group were working with one of the highly cre- \native architects. The third group was a cross-section sample \nof members of the American Institute of Architects, matched \nto the creative architects on age and geographical location. \nThe proportion of Intuitive types decreases significantly \nbetween the first, second, and third groups. The contrast \nbetween first and third groups yields a chi-square of 17.0 \n(p &lt; .001). Not only docs the proportion of Intuitive types \nincrease with level of creativity, but there is also an increasc in \nthe Intuition preference score. The mean score for Intuition \nwas 36.2 for the very creative group, 29.6 lor their colleagues, \nand 27.5 for the representative sample of architects. \n\nWhere samples differ in level of creativity, less creative \nsamples still have a majority of Intuitive types, but the pro- \nportion is lower. 1t may be also, as with the architects, that \nthe most creative samples not only have more Intuitive \ntypes but also express a clearer preference for Intuition. \nMost samples have a majority of Introverts, though \nExtraverts and Introverts arc more nearly divided in cre- \native samples that are associated with performance. In most \nof the artistic samples, Feeling types are in the majority; in \nmathematics and science, Thinking types outnuniber feel- \ning types. Isabel B. Myers predicted that creativity would be \nassociated with the open, curious receptivity of the Perceiv- \ning attitude. This prediction is mainly upheld. Indeed, in \nthe samples grouped by levels of creativity, greater creativity \nis associated with a higher proportion of Perceiving types. \n\nGough (1981) reported a series of samples ranked by an \nexperimental MBTI Creativity Index based on 20 years of \ncreativity research at IPAR. The experimental Creativity \nIndex based on Form G continuous scores is as follows: \n\nMBTI Creativity Index = 3SN + JP  El  STF. \n\nFor samples in which an external or internal criterion \nfor creativity was available, the data show that the Creativ- \nity Index is significantly and positively correlated with the \ncriterion (Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985). \n\n192 \n\nResearch \n\nTable 9.14  Self-Descriptions and Rater Descriptions Associated with MBTI Preferences \n\nExtraversion Introversion \n\nMeasure Measure \n\nMales Males",

As in the data above, the association with the TF \nand E-1 dichotomies is less clear, though originality may bc \nmore apparent in Extraverts in younger samples. \n\nOther Representative Studies \nof Differences Between Preferences \n\nThis section describes other studies relevant to Jungs theory. \nStudies related to careers and education are not included \nhere. Carlson and Levy (1973) and Carlson (1980) tested \ntype theory by predicting which types should have the maxi- \nmum difference on specific variables. They selected these \ntypes for experiments testing their hypotheses. \n\nThe Carlson and Levy (1973) study tested the relation- \nship between the MBTI and the following: \n\nB Short-term memory using the Digit Span of the Wechsler \nAdult Intelligence Scale? and memory for faces in the \nLightfoot Facial Expression Series. They found that ITs \nscored higher than EFs on digit span, and EFs scored \nhigher than ITs on recognizing faces. \n\nE Memory task performance using geometric figures with \nnumbers on the sides and geometric figures with fictitious \nnames on the sides. They found that Hs were higher than \nEFs in the discrepancy between numbers minus names. \n\nB Person perception using recorded judgments of 20 stan- \ndardized slides, 2 each for 10 emotions. They found that \nNPs scored higher than SJs, and females scored higher \nthan males. \n\nB Volunteering for social service using the amount of vol- \nunteering of 10 students in a halfway house. They found \n7 of IO volunteers and only 1 of the controls to be ENFP \nor ENTP. \n\nCarlson (1980) tested the following relationships between \nthe MBTI and other variables: \n\nB Quality of alfective memories was tested using blind rat- \nings of critical incidents recalling significant personal \nexperience by judges familiar with type theory. Carlson \nfound that judges correctly identified eight of nine EF \ntypes and five of six IT types. \n\n8 Interpersonal closeness or distance using the same set of \nmemories as above but rated for presence of individual \nor interpersonal quality. Carlson found that Introverts \ngave more individual and Extraverts more interpersonal \nmemories of joy, excitement, and shame. \n\n@ Cognitive clarity and vividness of feeling using the same \nset of memories as above edited to leave only statements \nof personal experience, also rated blind by a new set of \njudges. EF memories were rated significantly more vivid \nin expression than IT memories in joy, excitement, and \nshame. \n\nB Type dillerences in personal constructs using judges \nblind ratings of concrete or inferential constructs on an \nabbreviated version of the Role Construct Repertory Test \n(Kelly, 1955). Judges identified inferential constructs on \n16 of 20 Intuitive types and 3 of 14 Sensing types. See \nalso Howland (1971) for a similar study. \n\nOrientation to Time Type theory predicts that Sensing \ntypes are more oriented to present events since the present \nis what can be perceived by the senses. Intuitive types are \nmore attuned to the future, since Intuition is the function \nthat sces possibilities beyond the immediate present. \nThinking types are expected to be more concerned with the \nsequence of time from past through present to future, since \nThinking is concerned with cause-effect sequences. Feeling \ntypes are expected to be more oriented toward the past, \nsince values are transmitted as the heritage of the past. For \ncach type, the two functions may complement or conflict \nwith one another. For example, SF is concerned with the \npresent moment, but thc present moment is colored by past \n\nvalues. Thus one would expect SF types to be relatively \nmore conservative. The NF group, however, can be seen as \npulled toward the future by [Intuition and toward the past \nby Feeling. These contrasting forces can be expected to \ndiffer in the four NF types as a result of the interplay of \nthe dominant and auxiliary functions and depending on \nwhether these are extraverted or introverted. Time per- \nspective of the Jungian functions is discussed in Mann, \nSiegler, and Osmond (1968). \n\nThere are fewer hypotheses about time and the attitudes, \nthough one would expect Extraverts to be more aware of \ntime changes in the world around them and to see time in \nmore discrete units. Introverts should be more oriented \ntoward ideas that have more continuity and relatively less \naware of changes in the world around them. Thus Intro- \nverts may be expected to be less accurate in evaluating the \ntime of events. \n\n[sabel Myers hypothesized that Intuitive types are less \naccurate than Sensing types in projecting how long any \ngiven task will require.

Organized Judging types can be expected to \ntake time more seriously than spontaneous Perceiving types \nand to be more effective in meeting deadlines. \n\nEvans (1976) and Yang (1981) supported theoretical \nconnections between Sensing and the present, Intuition and \nthe future, Feeling and the past, and Thinking and no time \nzone. Studies of type differences in ease of visualizing the \nfuture found longer extensions with Intuition and Thinking \nand shorter ones with Sensing and Feeling (Harrison, 1984; \nNightingale, 1973; Seiden, 1970; Smith, 1976). \n\nOne would expect Extraverts to experience the world in \ndiscrete units of time. This expectation was supported by \nSeiden (1970), who found that Extraverts related their \nidentity to events or ceremonies that represented change. \nExtraverts were also more accurate in autokinetic time per- \nception (Veach &amp; Touhey, 1971). Intreverts, who are ori- \nented to ideas that are more continuous than external \nevents, see lime as more continuous (Seiden, 1970) or \noceanic (Knapp &amp; Lapuc, 1965). Nightingale (1973) found \nthat Introverts extend time farther back into the past; \nExtraverts extend time farther forward into the future. \n\nOrganized Judging types can be expected to take time \nmore seriously than spontaneous Perceiving types and to be \nmore effective in meeting deadlines. Evidence for J-P differ- \nences in time management appears in a study by Jaffe (1980), \nin which Sensing, Thinking, and Judging managers were \nmore successful with management by objectives. In student \npopulations there are often significant correlations between \nJudging and planning and control, which are essential cle- \nments of time management. For example, Table 9.16 shows \nthe correlations of MBTI Form G continuous scores with the \nTime Management Questionnaire (Williams, Verble, Price, &amp; \nLayne, 1995) in a sample of 204 students.

Used with permission \n\nstudies, Judging students took fewer incompletes (Smith, \nIrey, &amp; McCaulley, 1973), and Judging medical school appli- \ncants completed their applications earlier (Kainz &amp; McCaul- \nley, 1975). Sex differences also appear to be important in \nsome samples; Marcus (1976) and Squyres (1980) also found \ndifferences in the populations they studied, and in the \nWilliams et al. (1995) study, long-range planning was corre- \nlated with Extraversion and Sensing as well as with Judging. \n\nThe studies provide support for the predicted differences \nin the experience and use of time for different MBTI types. \nThere is another important study of type and time orienta- \ntion by Harrison and Lawrence (1985). However, since this \nstudy was primarily concerned with whole types rather \nthan individual preferences, the results are reported in the \nwhole type section of this chapter. \n\nFantasy and Imagery Representative studies of fantasy and \nimagery and MBTI types are Edmunds (1982), Ireland and \nKernan-Schloss (1983), O'Haire and Marcia (1980), and \nPalmiere (1972). These studies found that, as predicted, \nboth fantasy and imagery are of more interest to Intuitive \ntypes. In addition, significant differences are found \nconcerning the content and affect of images. The results of \nthese studies can be related to the time orientation studies \nin that fantasy and imagery can be conceived of as ways of \nsuspending time. \n\nIntroversion and the Preference for Privacy Marshall \n(1971) studied preference for privacy using a newly devcl- \noped scale called the Preference for Privacy Scale (PPS), \n\n196 Research \n\nwhich relates 10 a number of psychological and life behavior \nmeasures. The two preferences most closely associated with \naffiliation on the PPS are Extraversion and Feeling. Grant \n(1965) found that the four EF types among Auburn \nstudents were the only types that stated significantly more \noften that they dated more than once a week and had no \ntrouble finding dates. The Introverts and especially the IT \ntypes were dating less or not at all. The two preferences",

    "content": "most closely associated with a need for privacy are \nIntroversion and Thinking. \n\nMarshalls data show a consistent tendency for Introverts \nto prefer privacy on all the subscales of the PPS, but the \nmost important aspects of privacy for both Introverts and \nThinking types are personal space and lack of pressure for \nself-disclosure. Laypeople sometimes interpret Introversion \nand Thinking as being associated with a dislike of or a lack \nof need for people. The data are more consistent with the \nidea that Introverts and Thinking types enjoy the company \nof others, as long as they have their needed privacy or are \nnot under great stress. \n\nOptimism and Pessimism Isabel Myers believed that \nSensing and Intuition are often related to a pessimistic or \noptimistic attitude. In a difficult situation, the tendency of \nSensing is to assume that what is will not change. Clinicians \n(e.g., von Franz, 1971) note that tvpes with Sensing \ndominant often find that when intuitions do occur to them, \nthese are negative and pessimistic. (In ihe dynamics of type \ntheory, Intuition in a dominant Sensing type would be less \nconscious and differentiated and therefore less adept at \ncoping with reality problems.) The more optimistic \ntendency of Intuitive types is to assume that the situation \nmay be difficult now but that some hitherto unseen \npossibility will turn up. \n\nExtraversion and Introversion can be related to opti- \nmism for a different reason. Extraverts in theory are more at \nhome in the world, and thus they may also report them- \nselves as more competent to cope with its demands. \n\nQuenk (1966) looked at type differences as part of a \nstudy of fantasy and personal outlook in relation to opti- \nmism, pessimism, realism, and anxiety. Responses of the 25 \nmale and 32 female subjects who recorded daydreams for \n10 days showed consistent sex dilferences. Significant \nMBTI findings were that optimists were more likely to be \nExtraverts in both sexes; female optimists were more likely \nto be Intuitive types, and male optimists were more likely to \nbe Thinking types; anxious females were more likely to be \nIntroverts and Intuitive types; anxious males were more \nlikely to be Feeling types. In another aspect of the study, \nstudents reporting realistic fantasies were reported to have a \nclearer preference for Sensing, as would he predicted. \n\nVaughan and Knapp (1963) reported a study of dimen- \nsions of pessimism in which a number of instruments, \nincluding the MBTI, were administered to 75 male Wesleyan \nUniversity undergraduates. Pessimism was significantly asso- \nciated with Introversion and Thinking, confirming the E-I \ndifference found by Quenk but not the male T-F difference. \n\nPrediction of Specialty Choices in Medicine Isabel \nMyers medical sample provides an example of long-term \nprediction of type differences. She followed her longitudinal \nsample of 5,355 medical students over a decade from \nadmission to medical school and found specialty choices \nsignificantly in the directions predicted by type theory. \nMcCaulley (1977) followed up on the sample a decade \nlater and found that those who changed specialty \nsignificantly more often moved to specialties appropriate for \ntheir types; the effect was greater for Intuitive types than for \nSensing types. \n\nValidity of Whole Types \nand Type Dynamics \n\nSince the purpose of the Indicator is to help people identify \ntheir whole type, validation of the instrument as a measure \nof the theory requires evidence that the four dichotomies \ncombine in such a way that the whole is greater than the \nsum of its parts. In other words, characteristics or behavior \nbased either on whole types or on combinations of prefer- \nences demonstrating type dynamics should not be explain- \nable based on knowledge of the preferences alone. Because \nthe instrument is based on a complex theory, establishing \nthis kind of validity is more difficult than acquiring evi- \ndence for the validity of the four individual scales. This sec- \ntion presents validity evidence for whole types and for com- \nbinations of preferences based on type dynamics theory. \n\nComparison of MBTI Types \nwith Self-Estimates of Type \n\nOne way to validate the MBTI assessment tool that avoids \nsome of the problems identified above is to compare MBTI \nresults with self-assessment of type preferences. The chance \nof picking the correct type is I out of 16, or 6.25%. There \nhave been two kinds of studies of best-fit type, differenti- \nated on the basis of how the persons self-assessment of type \nwas determined. One category includes assessments that \nare based on agreement with written type descriptions of \nMyers and others. While the focus of some of these studies \nhas actually been on the accuracy of the written type \ndescriptions themselves, the results provide evidence for \nthe existence of the typology to the extent that the type \ndescriptions are based on Jungs and Myers theories of",

In each study, students were asked to \nrank five of Myers descriptions from Introduction to Type: \n(a) the type reported by the MBTI, (b) the type with the \nleast clear preference reversed, (c) the type with the same \nfunctions but E-I and J-P reversed, (d) the type with S-N \nand TF reversed, and (e) the type with all four letters dif- \nferent from the reported type. The reported type was ranked \nfirst significantly more often than chance for both samples \n(3596 p  .001, and 5096 p  .001). \n\nWhen choices for the descriptions of the reported type \nand the type with the closest scale reversed were combined, \nthe percentages of students rating one or the other of these \nfirst were 66% for the first study and 75% for the second \nstudy. The percentages of students giving first rank to the \nopposite of the reported type were +% and 13% in the two \nstudies. Students in both studies were significantly (p &lt; \n.001) less likely to select as most accurate the description \ndiffering from the reported type on the functions (S-N and \nT-F) than they were to choose the type differing from the \nreported type on the attitudes (E-l and J-P}. The authors \nconcluded that (a) the idea that type descriptions other than \nones reported type might be equally appealing had been \nrefuted and (b) their subjects seemed to feel more confi- \ndence or certainty in their preferred functions (S, N, T, or F) \nand/or more flexibility in their attitudes (E, 1, J, or P). These \n\n\\ \n\n/ \n\nfindings strongly refute any suggestion that respondents \ninterpret MBTI type descriptions as simple horoscopes. \n\nIn a similar study, Ware and Yokomoto (1985) asked stu- \ndents to rate (ona scale of 0 to 100%) the accuracy of differ- \nent type profiles developed by David Keirsey. Unknown to \nthe participants, one of these profiles matched their type as \ndetermined hy the MBTI, while the others varied in system- \natic ways. The type description based on their MBTI type \nwas rated highest, at 6296. The description yielding the next \nhighest rating (4796) was the one that resulted from chang- \ning the preference letter associated with the persons lowest \npreference score to its opposite. \n\nWe turn now to the methodology whereby the self- \nassessment is made after receiving an MBTI interpretation \nfrom a trained professional. Hammer and Yeakley (1987) \nstudied a sample of 120 adults who had participated in \nworkshops and individual interviews. Results indicated \nthat 85% of the sample produced perfect agreement on all \nfour preferences and that 99% of the sample agreed on at \nleast three of the four. All the individuals who disagreed on \none or more preference scales had preference scores of \nseven points or less on the scale in dispute. \n\nKummerow (1988) examined the agreement between \nbest-ht type and MBTI reported type in samples of retail \nmanagers and male and female bank managers who had par- \nticipated in an MBTI training program. The procedure fol- \nlowed by the participants in arriving at their self-assessment \n\n198 Research \n\nof type is well documented, making this study a model for \nother such studies. The agreements with whole type were \n6496, 66%, and 58%, respectively. The agreement of three or \nmore letters was 97%, 95%, and 90% for these samples. The",

Identification of whole best-fit \ntypes and reported MBTI types agreed for 75% of the sub- \njects; approximately 96% agreed on at least three of the four \npreferences. Walck also found that over 8096 of the dis- \nagrcements between best-fit type and MBTI-measured type \noccurred among individuals with \"slight\" preferences \n(1-9). Disagreement was most prevalent on the TF scale. \n\nThe agreement between best-fit type and MBTI reported \ntype has been determined for participants attending the \nMBTI qualifying programs (Hammer, Prehn, &amp; Mitchell, \n1994). At thc end of each four- or five-day workshop partic- \nipants are asked to complete a best-fit type questionnaire. \nThe whole type agreement for males is 8196 (N 2 533) and \nfor females 82% (N = 989). These findings are especially \nimportant because of the size of the samples and because \nthe intensive training experience offers multiple opportuni- \nties for participants to assess their best-fit type. \n\nWhile the results are not shown in Table 9.17 because \nthey focused solely on the T-F scale, Harris and Carskadon \n(1988) conducted a study of self-assessment accuracy with \n339 male and 306 female students. Using the current Form \nG weights, the agreement between the students MBTI T-F \npreference and their self-assessment of the T-F preference \nwas 61% for the males and 79% for the females. \n\nThree self-assessment studics have been conducted with \nForm M to date. The results are also shown in Table 9.17. In \nthe sample used to set the midpoint of the preference scales, \nthe agreement between best-fit and Form M-based whole \ntypes was 78% (see Chapter 7 for a description of this pro- \nccdure). The large-scale best-fit study used as a basis for \ndetermining the optimal scoring procedure yielded a num- \nber of estimates of best-fit agreement, some based on item \nresponse theory (IRT) methods and others on prediction \nratio methods lor sclecting items and scoring. The best IRT \nmcthod yielded 6496 and the best prediction ratio (PR) \nmethod 58% overall agreement. Note that these are proba- \nbly underestimates of true hit rates because no attempt had \nbeen made to optimize the midpoint for either procedure. \nThe third self-assessment study compared Form G and \nForm M results with best-fit type in a sample of 92 adults \nfrom a small rural midwestern town who had no previous \nexposure to the MBTI. The agreement with best-fit type for \nForm G was 53% and for Form M was 58%. It is interesting \nto note that most of the misses in this sample occurred in \nolder respondents (in their 70s and 80s). \n\nThe results of past best-fit type studies have been gener- \nally quite supportive of the construct validity of the MBTI, \nwith whole type agreements ranging from 53% to 85%. \nSamples of adults that used multiple verification procedures \ngenerally have higher agreement. All of the percentage \nagreements from studics using this methodology are far \nabove the chance value of 6.25%. In the Form G samples \nthe T-F scale showed the lowest agreement. \n\nIn the methodology using written type descriptions, the \nagreement has ranged from 35% to 6296, with the former \ncoming from the study where subjects were required to \nrank, not rate, clescriptions. These figures also are far above \nthe chance value. Even more telling is the fact that in two of \nthese studies the rating of the opposite type description was \n496 and 13%. \n\nThis percentage agreement in the best-fit studies is cven \nmore impressive when agreement on three instead of all four \nletters of the type is considered; these percentages ranged \nover 95% in all studies in which this was reported. This is \nimportant because in an instrument like the MBTI, where \nwhole type is arrived at using four separate scales, high levels \nof agreement for whole type require extremely high levels of \nagrcement on cach scale. For example, if the best-fit agree- \nment was, say, 9096 on each preference scale, and we multi- \nply these percentages as if they were independent probabili- \ntics, the expected percentage agreement is only 66%. So \nagreements in the 70% and 80% ranges indicate a very high \ndegree of validity, in terms of percentage agreement, for the \nindividual MBTI scales. \n\nIt is also intcresting to note that in the few studies that \nreported agreement by clarity of preference, almost all of \nthe disagrcements occurred on scales for which the person \nhad a preference clarity index in the slight range.

In some cases (e.g., Kummerow, \n1988, or the qualifying programs) the procedure has been \ndescribed quite accurately and it seems likely that the per- \nson had cvery opportunity to discover his or her best-fit \ntype. In some studies, it may be that the MBTI results are \nactually better predictors of true type than are the stimuli \nbeing used in the verification process. If the stimuli consist \nof lists of words, work bchavior examples, or personal \ncxamples that are idiosyncratic to the interpreter, they may \nbe responsible for much more noise in the self-assessment \nthan is present in the assessment accomplished by the stan- \ndard and tested items of the Indicator.

In the first category are those combinations explicitly \ndefined by the theory. These are the combinations of all four \npreferences that yield a complete type, as well as the combi- \nnations of fewer preferences that reflect the dynamic aspects \nof the types (e.g., dominant extraverted Thinking types). \n\nThe second category of preference combinations might \nbe called elementary intcractions. These are interactions \namong preferences that can provide evidence for the typo- \nlogical nature of the theory because they represent the ele- \nments of whole types. Although these combinations of pref- \nerences are not derived specifically from the dynamic \naspects of the theory to the extent that significant interac- \ntions among preferences can be demonstrated, they are \nimportant as building blocks of the theory. Many of these \ncombinations are also of interest in applied situations. The \nelementary interactions used most frequently involve pairs \nof preferences, such as ST, SE NE and NT, although some \ncombinations of three preferences have also received aiten- \ntion. See Chapter 4 of this manual and Hirsh (1992) for \nlabels given to various letter combinations, descriptions of \nthe characteristics associated with each, and explanations \nof how they are used by practitioners. \n\nIn either case, type theory predicts that the interactions of \npreferences result in behaviors that cannot be predicted from \n\neach preference separately. Because each preference in a \ngiven type interacts with all of the other preferences in that \ntype, type theory posits that any combination of two or more \npreferences will yield behaviors that are more than the sum \nof the parts. Validity research at this level focuses on demon- \nstrating that various combinations of two-, three-, and four- \nletter preferences interact to produce behavior that cannot be \naccounted for by the same preferences considered separately. \n\nCombinations of preferences derived from type dynamics \nare specific interactions between the E-I and J-P dichotomies \nthat serve to identify the forms (dominant or auxiliary) and \nattitudes (introverted or extraverted) of the Perceiving and \nJudging functions. The characteristics associated with the \nforins and attitudes of the functions transcend the set of gen- \neral qualities associated with each function. Dominant ex- \ntraverted Sensing, for example, refers to type characteristics \nthat are qualitatively unique and different from those charae- \nteristics shared by all Sensing types. This pattern of interac- \ntions creates within each type (a) a hierarchy of development \nof the four functions and (b) their accessibility to conscious \ncontrol. Type dynamics give each function within a type its \nstatus (as either a dominant, auxiliary, tertiary, or inferior",

Type \ndynamics for all functions and types are shown in Table 9.18. \n\nValidity research on dynamics involves finding evi- \ndence that among and within types the dominant, auxil- \niary, tertiary, and inferior functions and their attitudes can \n\n200 Research \n\nbe distinguished from each other and that the characteris- \ntics associated with each are in accord with those predicted \nby type theory. Because this is a relatively recent area of \nresearch, however, it is not always obvious how to translate \nthe predictions of type theory into researchable questions. \nFuture researchers may find additional important questions \nthat have yet to be asked in this area. Nevertheless, some \nimportant steps have been taken and are reviewed below. \n\nTo understand and critically evaluate some of the evi- \ndence that has accumulated at the level of whole types and \ntype dynamics, we must first understand some of the partic- \nular problems entailed in validating a theory-based instru- \nment. These problems reveal some subtleties of the theory \nthat tend to be overlooked when type is discussed only at a \nconceptual level. One of the advantages of using a theory- \nbased instrument like the MBTI, however, is that the inter- \nplay between theory and research enriches both. \n\nIssues in Conducting Validity Studies \nof Preference Interactions \n\nValidity studies of preference interactions, whether they be \nwhole types or type dynamics, raise unique problems that \nmust be understood before results can be interpreted and \nunderstood. Many of these problems arise from attempts to \napply methodologies developed for and based on trait \ninstruments to the study of typological theories. Among the \nproblems discussed here are the following: \n\nm Use of dependent variables rich enough to validate the \nmultifaceted constructs of type theory \n\n Use of a criterion with adequate precision \n\n&amp; Dependent variables with sufficient range to differentiate \nthe 16 MBTI types \n\nB Use of appropriate statistical criteria for demonstrating \ntype differences | \n\nB Use of multiple dependent variables \n\nB Sample size requirements \n\nMultifaceted Dependent Variables Each of the four \ndichotomies on which the MBTI assessment tool is based \nis an example of what Carver has called multifaceted \nconstructs, which he defines as constructs that are \ncomposed of two or morc subordinate concepts, cach of \nwhich can be distinguished conceptually from the others \nand measured separately, despite being related to each other \nboth logically and empirically\" (Carver, 1989, p. 577). \nJungs descriptions of the psychological functions and \nattitudes are a fundamental example of a multifaceted \nconstruct. And the research underlying ihe development of \nthe subscales in the MBTI Stcp II and Step III scoring \nsystems provides empirical evidence of the multifaceted \nnature of the preference scales. \n\nWhen choosing dependent variables to test type theory, \ntherefore, it is important that whenever possible, broad or \n\nlikewise multifaceted dependent variables be used. Unfor- \ntunately, many validation studies emphasize the measure- \nment of singular, unidimensional concepts; consequently, \nMBTI scales, which are not homogeneous or unitary, are \nviewed as problematic. Although narrow or unitary mea- \nsures may, in some instances, or with some analvtic strate- \ngies, be appropriate criteria to validate the separate \ndichotomies of the MBTI, they may be misleading when \nconsidering interactions of preferences. When a complex, \nmultifaceted independent variable is used to predict a \nhomogeneous dependent variable, it is likely that only cer- \ntain facets of the complex variable will be related to the \nsimple variable. If this is true, then little of the variance in \nthe dependent measure will be explained. This problem is \ncompounded when a four-way interaction is tested in \nANOVA. It is unlikely that all of the many facets of the \nfour complex variables interact with each other in such a \nway that their interaction will account for a significant \npercentage of the variance in a single, narrowly defined \ndependent measure. Narrow, unitary variables simply do \nnot share enough content with MBTI scales to allow for \nthe discovery of interactions among the four dichotomies. \nTo find significant interactions, more complex and multi- \nfaceted dependent variables must be used, but these are \ndifficult to find since most instruments used to provide \ncriterion variables are based on unitary variables devel- \noped using traditional] psychometrics. \n\nMeasurement Precision Measurement error always \ndecreases one's ability to find meaningful differences \nbetween the groups of interest. The inverse of measurement \nerror is precision. All measurement is conducted with some \ndegree of error. Consequently, all observations based on \nmeasurements contain a degree of slack that yields a \ncertain amount of uncertainty in the results. For example,",

    "content": "when comparing the mean of two types on a dependent \nvariable, there is always some error and therefore \nuncertainty as to what the real mean of each type is. The \nlarger the standard error of the dependent variable, the \ntarther apart the group (type) means must be to justify \na conclusion that the difference between the types is rcal \nand not just a result of chance variation. So when the \ncriterion measures or dependent variables in a type \nvalidation study have a large standard error (are imprecise), \nit is more difficult to find theoretically predicted differences \nbetween types. A lot of background noise must be \novercome before the real differences stand out. Large \nsamples can help reduce standard errors, although in \npractice it is time-consuming and expensive to obtain \nsufficiently large samples of all 16 types to reduce standard \nerrors significantly. \n\nMeasurement Range Another problem in conducting type \nvalidation research results from using variables that yield \nonly a narrow range of possible scores. This problem \n\ncompounds the difficulties created by imprecise \nmeasurement. An extreme example would be to use as a \ncriterion variable a single Likert scale (e.g., a simple 1 to 7 \nrating scale). If this scale were to be used to compare the \nmeans ol the 16 types, the maximum possible separation \nbetween the means of the types would be less than 0.5 \npoint. If that were the case, to conclude that the 16 means \nwere significantly different from one another the standard \ndeviations (SDs) for each tvpe group would have to be less \nthan 0.2. Given that SDs for Likert scales are typically \ngreater than 1.0, it would be virtually impossible to \nconclude that the 16 types have scores on that variable that \ndiffer significantly from one another. \n\nAnalytic Techniques for Demonstrating Type Differences \nOne technique for examining type validity makes use of \nanalvsis of variance (ANOVA), which involves dividing up \nthe variance in a dependent variable and finding out how \nmuch of it can be explained by the effects of the in- \ndependent variables. In these analyses, preferences or \ncombinations of preferences are the independent variables, \nand some other variable is the dependent variable whose \nvariance is being partitioned. After all of variance in the \ndependent variable that is attributable to the separate \nindependent variables has been identified, the remaining \nvariance is then examined io determine how much of it can \nbe explained by interactions among the independent \nvariables. For example, if all four preferences were used as \nindependent variables in an ANOVA, and the variance \nattributable to the main effects (the four preference scales) \nhas been determined, the researcher might be interested in \nexamining two-wav, three-way, or four-way interactions \namong the preferences, depending on the research question. \nIf these interaction effects are indeed present, then they are \nevidence that the combinations of preferences are more \nthan the sum of the parts. In MBTI research, such inter- \nactions are one way of validating the typological nature of \nthe Indicator. \n\nFrom a typological perspective, the fundamental unit of \nanalysis is the whole type. For this reason, researchers \nshould consider using whole types as the independent vari- \nables in their analyses. It is not necessary to use all 16 types: \nit depends on what hypothesis is being tested and whether \nall 16 types would be expected to differ on the specific \ndependent variable. Such analyses would provide better \ntests of the theory, regardless of the fact that types are iden- \ntified by the results on four separate dichotomies. There are \nprecedents in other sciences, however, for identifying larger \nunits of analysis by measuring several characteristics sepa- \nrately. For example, the natural sciences all identify species \n(1.e., categories) by taking separate measurements or obser- \nvations on different variables. The measurement of types by \nseparately seoring the four MBTI dichotomies is a direct \nparallel to how species are identified in biology: \n\nValidity  201 \n\nUse of Multiple Dependent Variables Evidence of the \nvalidity of various preference combinations does not require \nthat all 16 types be distinguishable from each other on a \nsingle dependent variable, on a single experimental task, or \nin a single social context. Failure to find significant \ndifferences among all I6 types on a given dependent \nvariable does not disconfirm the MBTI as a typology. As the \ntheory states, each type is quite similar to several others: \nEach type differs from four others by only one letter, from \nsix others by just two letters, and from four others by three \nletters. Because of this overlap the 16 types should be \ndistinctly different from each other in some ways but like \none another in other ways. The parallel between comparing \npsychological types and comparing species in biology is",

As Carlson and Levy \npoint out, ^[S]ince any particular situation will invoke only \na portion of the typological pattern, critical predictions \nshould be based upon those components of the total type \npattern which are intrinsically relevant to the problem at \nhand (Carlson &amp; Levy, 1973, p. 563). In other words, \nbecause particular variables, tasks, and contexts tend to \nelicit behaviors that are relevant only to subsets of the four \ndichotomies, it is unlikely that analysis of a single variable, \ntask, or context will reveal all possible differences among \nthe 16 types. \n\nSample Size Requirements The basic unit of analysis in \nvalidity research of whole types is the whole type. Because \nthe 16 types are unequally distributed not only in \noceupational groups but also in the population at large, \nfinding samples that contain a sufficient number of the less \nfrequent types can be difficult. And because the types of \npeople are not known before the data are collected, it is \noften necessary to collect large numbers of cases in order to \nget enough people of the less frequent types. \n\nEven in studies that involve fewer than four-way interac- \ntions, it is still important to obtain enough people of each \ntype whose preferences contain that interaction. If there are \nunequal numbers of types, then the findings may primarily \nreflect the characteristics of the most frequent type in the \ngroup. For example, in a study looking at two-way interac- \ntions of the E-1 and S-N scales, the E-I x S-N interaction \nincludes four groups of types: EN, ES, IN, and IS. The EN \ngroup includes ENFP, ENTE ENFJ, and ENT]. If the sample \nof ENs contains 20 ENTPs and 25 ENFPs, but only + ENFJs \nand 5 ENTJs, then whatever conclusions are drawn about \nENs will apply primarily to ENTPs and ENFPs.

Because miss- \ning data varied by dependent variable and respondent, sep- \narate samples were drawn for the analysis of each depen- \ndent variable. For each of these variables, equal numbers of \neach type were randomly selected from the respondents \nwho had answered that item. Because some data were miss- \ning, these numbers ranged from 29 to 48 for each type. \nANOVA was used to test for main effects of the four \ndichotomous preferences and for all two-way, three-way, \nand four-way interactions. \n\nAltogether, 73 dependent variables were tested. Table \n9.19 reports the number of times each of the main \neffects and interactions were found to be significant in \n\nthis set of dependent variables. It also shows the average \nsignificance level for each effect, the average percent- \nage of variance accounted for, and the range of percentage \nof variance accounted for by each main and interaction \neffect. \n\nThe findings reported in this table may be summarized \nand interpreted as follows: \n\nw Every possible interaction among the four MBTI \ndichotomies is significant in predicting some of the inde- \npendent variables in this study. These various interac- \ntions among the dichotomies are one piece of evidence \nfor a typology. \n\nm Among the variables tested in this study, the main effects",

    "content": "are predictive of more variables and usually account for \nmore variance than do the interactions. Fifty-nine of the \nstudy variables were predicted by one or more main \neffects, while 34 were predicted by one or more interac- \ntions. The percentage of variance accounted for ranged \nfrom 0.5% to 10.30% for main effects and from 0.5% to \n2.90% for the interactions. \n\nm The E-I x J-P interaction predicted the variance of only \none of the variables analyzed. All other interactions pre- \ndicted variance for three or more variables. This is not \nsurprising because according to type theory, the E-I x \nJ-P interaction is the basis for identifying type dynamics \ngroups for the four functions. Consequently, we would \nexpect to find this interaction to be more predictive \nwhen tested within each function than when tested in a \ngroup of all 16 types. (See the section on type dynamics \nbelow for a test of within-function interactions of E-I \n\nand J-P.) \n\nThe results of this study provide particularly convincing \nevidence that the four MBTI dichotomies cohere as type \ntheory describes. Because there were equal numbers of the \n16 types in all of the ANOVA analyses, all of the interac- \ntions were statistically independent of the main effects due \nto the four separate dichotomies. No assumptions had to be \nmade about which effects were primary and needed to be \nconsidered first. The finding that all possible interactions \nwere predictive of at least some ol the dependent variables \nin these ANOVAs is clear evidence that the MBTI measures \na typology and not just four separate traits. \n\nStudies of Type Dynamics Theory \n\n'alidation of type dynamies goes a step beyond asking \nwhether whole types can be distinguished from one \nanother. In studies of type dynamics, the focus is on deter- \nmining whether particular groups of types, defined by psy- \nchological type theory, differ in observable ways. Evidence \nfor the validity of the MBTI as a measure of type dynamics \nwould include results indicating that the status of the fune- \ntions (e.g., dominant Feeling versus auxiliary Feeling), the \nattitudes of the functions (e.g., introverted Sensing versus \nextraverted Sensing), or both (e.g., dominant introverted \nIntuition versus dominant extraverted Intuition) are dilfer- \nent from each other. For example, we might wish to see \nhow extraverted Thinking when it is dominant, as in ESTJs \nand ENT]s, differs from extraverted Thinking when it serves \nas the auxiliary function, as in ISTJs and INTJs. We might \nalso seek to find differences between the dominant intro- \nverted Intuition of INFJs and INTJs and the dominant \nextraverted Intuition of ENFPs and ENTPs. \n\nTo simplify discussion of these issues, a three-letter code \nhas been constructed that can be used as a shorthand label \nfor all possible combinations of types defined by dynamics \ntheory. The first letter in the code designates the status of \nthe function, the second the attitude in which the function \nis expressed, and the third the function being considered. \nThus, when considering the function of Intuition, there are \nfour type dynamics groups to compare with each other: \ndominant introverted Intuition (DIN); dominant extraverted \nIntuition (DEN); auxiliary introverted Intuition (AIN); and \nauxiliary cxtraverted Intuition (AEN). To find the type \ndynamics groups for the other functions, substitute that \n\nValidity 203 \n\nfunctions letter as the last letter in the three-letter codes for \neach type dynamic group. \n\nThree-letter descriptive code \n\nIst letter = 2nd letter = Sore 3 S e \n\nStatus Attitude Function \n\nD= dominant 1] = introverted S = Sensing \n\nA = auxiliary E = extraverted N = Intuition \nT = Thinking \nF = Feeling \n\nOther comparisons may involve only the dominant ver- \nsus the auxiliary. form of a function. This comparison \nwould be used to determine whether the status of a func- \ntion explains a difference in behaviors or characteristics \nassociated with certain types. For example, for Intuition the \ncontrast would be between the DIN + DEN types and the \nAIN + AEN types. At other times, the comparison may \ninvolve only the two different attitudes of the functions to \none another; this would be a test of whether attitude alone \ncan explain differenees in behaviors or characteristics \namong certain types. With Intuition, for example, the con- \ntrast would be between the DIN + AIN and the DEN + AEN \ntypes. Which comparisons are analyzed depends on what \nquestions are being asked or what hypotheses about type \ndynamics are being tested. Table 9.18 shows the types com- \nposing each type dynamic group for the four functions. \n\nAmong the earliest studies to examine differences \nbetween the dominant and auxiliary functions were those \nby Carlyn (1975), McCarley and Carskadon (1983), and \nWilliams and Carskadon (1983). The strategy in all of these \nstudies involved counting the number of people with \nhigher seores on their dominant function than on their aux-",

The thinking was that if the dominant func- \ntion was, as predicted, the most favored, most psychologi- \ncally salient, or most under conscious control, the score for \nthat function should be higher than for the auxiliary func- \ntion. However, in all three studies only half or fewer of the \npeople had higher scores for the dominant function than \nfor the auxiliary function. \n\nMyers and MeCaulley (1985), using a large database \n(N = 43,063) of Forms F and G, found that in only about \nhall the cases were the scores on the dominant function \nhigher than those on the auxiliary function. McCrae and \nCosta (1989), after standardizing the preferenee scores to \nadjust for the facet that the S-N continuous score had a \ngreater range than the T-F continuous score, revealed, \nusing a chi-square analysis of +56 cases, no signifteant asso- \nciation between the largest preference score and the theo- \nretically predicted dominant function. Most recently, Murry, \nMagidson, and Markham (1997) attempted to find differ- \nences between dominant and auxiliary functions. Scoring \nthe MBTI using IRT, they compared mean preference \nscores of dominant and auxiliary types for each function. \nThey believed IRT scoring would yield a more aecurate \n\n204 Research \n\nidentification of type preferences. Despite the improvement \nin scoring, and despite their use of a more rigorous \"hybrid\" \nlatent trait/latent class model, they were unable to find any \nsupport for making a distinction between any of the domi- \nnant and auxiliary functions. Although these findings \nappear to be contrary to the predictions of type theory, it is \nimportant to examine the hypotheses tesied in these studies \nand the assumptions that undcrlie the approaches taken by \nthese authors to testing their hypotheses. \n\nFirst, all of the analyses described above either tacitly or \nexplicitly assign unintended meaning to high or low prefer- \ncnce scorcs. Even the original hypothesis that drives these \nanalysesthat the persons score on the dominant function \nshould be higher than the score on the auxiliary function \nis not consistent with current interpretations of the theory \n(Myers &amp; Kirby, 1994) and is therefore not a good test of \ntype theory. The magnitude of the preference scores used in \nthese studies does not indicate development, skill, aptitude, \nmaturity, or excellence in the use of a function. (The same \nis true of the preference clarity indexes used in Form M.) \nYet the meaning ascribed to thesc scores by the hypothesis \nand the analyses that derive from it ignores the categorical \nnature of the preference scales and assumes a quantitative \nlinkage between the propertics measured by the MBTI and \nthe scores used to identify type preferences. \n\nSecond, the item responses that form the basis for classi- \nfying people into different preferences are designed to \nappeal to people of one preference or the other ona given \nscale. For example, the S response to an S-N item was \nwritten 10 appeal to all Sensing types. Measurement at this \ngross level of the overall preferences does not permit direct \ninferences about the dominant or auxiliary status of the \nfunctions based solely on preference scores. \n\nQuantitative interpretation of preference clarity indexes is \nnot recommended for the Indicator. \n\nThird, by its very nature the dominant form of a function \nis presumed to be different from its auxiliary form. Myers \nmethod of identifying dominant versus auxiliary functions \nassumed an interaction between E-I and J-P dichotomies. \nThe impact of this interaction shows up in its effect on the \nforms and attitudes of the Judging and Perceiving functions. \n\nInteractive effects of the preferences produce something \nabove and beyond the effects of separate preferences. \n\nThe characteristics of dominant introverted Feeling, for \nexample, are different and separate from those facets of \nFeeling that are shared among all Feeling types. Few \nauthors have spelled out such differences explicitly (an \nexception is Myers &amp; Kirby, 1994). This is one arca of type \ntheory that is open for future development. Nevertheless, \nat present the theory presumes that such differences are \nreal and can be observed. Studies that simply compare \n\nscores of the dominant and auxiliary functions ignore \nthese differences. \n\nFortunately, there are several ways in which differences \nbetween dominant and auxiliary forms of the functions can \nbe observed that remain true to the theory. For example, \nobserver ratings of dominant and auxiliary Intuitive types \ncould be examined. Certain characteristics observed by the \nraters would be predicted 10 be more frequently associated \nwith people whose Intuitiou was dominant as compared \nwith those for whom Intuition was auxiliary. The dominant \nand auxiliary uses of the functions would be expected to \ndiffer in some, but not necessarily all, ways. Another \napproach might be to use ANOVA to compare thc mean",

The similarities will affect the scores just as much \nas the differences will. When a variable is mainly rclevant to \nthe attitude in which Thinking is used, then we do not nec- \nessarily expect that DIT will differ from AIT, or DET from \nAET. However, across a diverse collection of variables relc- \nvant to the Thinking function, we do expect that all type \ndynamics groupings will differ in some respects on at least \nsome of the variables. \n\nThere are other problems in addition to sclecting thc \nproper variables becausc the requirements for validating the \nMBTI as a typology are more stringent than for trait-based \npersonality instruments not based on a theory of interac- \ntions. Validating type dynamics using ANOVA with a given \ndependent variable requires the following two conditions: \n(a) that the E-I x J-P interaction term is significant and (b) \nthat all of the type dynamics groups for cach function differ \nfrom one another. Both of these conditions are necessary; \nneither is sufficient by itself. \n\nEvidence lor the first condition will be immediately \navailable from the ANOVA results. Evidence for the second \ncondition requires that we demonstrate that the types hav- \ning different forms and attitudes of the four functions can \nbe distinguished from each other on the same variables for \nwhich the E-I x J-P interaction term was significant. For \nexample, consider an analysis that compares people with \n\n206 Research \n\ndominant introverted Thinking (DIT; ISTP and INTP) with \nthose with auxiliary extraverted Thinking (AET; ISTJ and \nINTJ) on a dependent variable called importance of friend- \nships.\" From a trait perspective, the only difference be- \ntween these types is their preference for Judging or Perceiv- \ning. Consequently any differences observed between these \ngroups should be only those attributable to the difference in \nthe J-P preference. Thus in the ANOVA only the J-P main \neffeet would be significant. From a type perspective, how- \never, we seek evidence that the differences between the DIT \nand AET groups is greater than what can be explained by \nthe J-P preference. If this is true, then in the ANOVA, the \nE-I x J-P interaction term should be significant among all \nThinking types. When extended to all four functions and to \nall the type dynamics groups within each function, this \nanalysis is a direct test of whether the MBTI accurately mea- \nsures the status and attitudes of the functions described by \ntype dynamics. \n\nTo test these conditions, the data from the national sam- \nple were used. National sample data were also collected on \nwork preferences, satisfaction, and values. Equal numbers \nof each type were randomly selected from the respondents \nwho had answered each item used as a dependent variable. \nBecause some people did not answer all of the non-MBTI \nquestions, the number of people of each type ranged from \n29 to 48, depending on which dependent variable was used. \nThis yielded between 58 and 96 people in each type dynam- \nics group (dominant introverted, dominant extraverted, \nauxiliary introverted, and auxiliary extraverted) for each \nfunction, depending on the dependent variable. \n\nFor each function, ANOVAs were conducted in two \nstages. In the first, the E-l and J-P dichotomies were the \nindependent variables. For each function, the interaction \nbetween these preferences defines the four possible type \ndynamics groups (EJ, IJ, EP, and IP). The dependent vari \nables were a series of items asking respondents about their \nsatisfaction with various aspects of their work environ- \nments, the importance to them of various life values, and \ntheir preference for working in various organizational \nstructures. Responses to these items were on a four-point \nLikert scale ranging from Very Satisfied to Very Dissatis- \nfied. ANOVAs were run separately for each function on the \nentire item pool. Items for which the interaction term was \nsignificant were identified lor further analysis in the second \nANOVA. \n\nThe second analysis using ANOVAs used the type \ndynamics groups for each function as the independent vari- \nable with four levels. The items for which the interaetion \nterms in the first ANOVA were significant were used as \ndependent variables in this second phase. The ANOVAs \nwere run separately for cach function. Following Toothaker \n(1991), the GH procedure was used for the multiple com- \nparisons among groups, and alpha was set at .OI.

Thus it seems likely that when the interac- \ntion terms are significant but the multiple comparisons are \nnot, the transdichotomous facets of type represented by the \ninteraction are in fact shared among the four type dynamies \ngroups. \n\nThis interpretation fits with both type theory and \nempirical observations of the 16 types.

Because we are \ndealing with a typology, there is no theoretical reason to \nbelieve that these commonalities and differences should be \nattributed only to the separate dichotomies that are either \nshared or different in the eight Thinking types. In fact, pre- \ncisely because the MBTI measures a typology, we would \nexpect that some transdichotomous facets of the Thinking \nfunction would be shared among the eight Thinking types \nand some would not. Table 9.21 and Table 9.23, then, show \nus results that are quite consistent with type theory in this \nrespect. \n\nOther results of this study demonstrate both a statisti- \ncally significant interaction term in the first-stage ANOVA \nand significant differences among the type dynamics groups \n\nTable 9.23 Dependent Variables for Which \nthe E~I x J-P Interaction Was \nSignificant in Thinking and \nFeeling Functions \n\nSignificant Interactions for \nThinking Type Dynamics Groups \n\np-Value of \nVariable Interaction Term \nSatisfaction with opportunities for learning at work .022 \nFrequency of helping, teaching, or counseling others \nin current job .026 \nLike working in organizations that have a variety \nof tasks .038 \nImportance of health in life .040* \nImportance of relationships and friendships in life .020* \n\nSignificant Interactions for \nFeeling Type Dynamics Groups \n\np-Value of \nVariable Interaction Term \nFrequency of helping, teaching or counseling others \nin current job .002* \n\na ee ee ee o  em 8-72 07 73] \nNote: * Variables for which one or more muluple comparison tests were \nsignificant at p &lt; 01.

This result suggests that \nthe effects of dissimilar facets of type on the dependent vari- \nable are being observed within the groups that differ. The \nresults for the variable health demonstrate this. The E-I x \nJ-P interaction term was significant for Thinking types on \nthis variable. The mean for AET (IST), INTJ) was 3.61, \nwhile the mean for DET (ESTJ, ENTJ) was 3.83. The E-I \nmain effect was significant, but because this effect is sepa- \nrate and independent from the significant interaction effect, \nit does not explain the difference in scores between thesc \ngroups.

This, then, is an example of \na wansdichotomous facet of type. \n\nThese findings make sense from the theory because \nMyers used the J-P dichotomy to help identify or point to \ntype dynamics groups.

And this is precisely what the results \nin Table 9.23 and Table 9.24 demonstrate. These outcomes \nthus serve as partial evidence for dynamic and typological \naspects measured by the MBTI. \n\nThe second requirement for validation of type dynamics \nwas only partially met in this study. Of the six comparisons \nmade for each function, three of the Thinking comparisons, \none of the Sensing comparisons, two of the Intuition com- \nparisons, and one of the Feeling comparisons were signifi- \ncant. These results, which provide partial validation for the \ntheory, may be a function of the dependent variables used in \neach analysis. Table 9.21, for example, reveals that two dif- \n\nferent variables were necded to distinguish DET from AET, \n\nDIT from AFT, and AET from AIT. Significantly, different \nvariables were required in order to distinguish the type \ndynamics groups for different functions. \n\nFrom a typological perspective, this is not surprising, \nsince the MBTI attempts to measure qualitative dilferences in \n\n210 Research \n\npersonality. Thus it is unlikely that any single variable would \nbe able to capture all of the important differences among the \ntypes. As the results here demonstrate, a diverse set of vari- \nables is required even to distinguish type dynamics groups \nfor a single function. Future validation efforts may need to \nconsider a greater variety of qualitatively different variables. \nFinding appropriate variables is difficult, however, because it \ndemands a knowledge of what behaviors, values, attitudes, \nor observations are most rclevant to the transdichotomous \naspects of type dynamics. It is much easier to identify appro- \npriate variables for validating single dichotomies than it is to \nidentify variables that are relevant to the transdichotomous \nfacets of type. It also may be necessary that the items, scales, \nor instruments used to measure these variables be multifac- \neted rather than strongly unidimensional. \n\nFinally, the results shown in Table 9.21 and Table 9.22 \nclearly confirm that the method used to identify type \ndynamics (i.e., the E-I x J-P interaction) corresponds to \nfacets of type beyond the four simple dichotomies. These \nfacets are present for all four functions. So while the results \nshown in the tables in this section substantiate the typologi- \ncal nature of the MBTI, future validation studics need to \nexplore what additional variables might help fill the gaps. \n\nStudies of Whole Types \n\nWhole type validity involves many different questions that \nmust be answered in ways that may be incompatible within \nthe design of a single study. And some of these questions \nrequire large numbers of each type. So within the con- \nstraints of time, money, staff, and the available pool of \nrespondents, sometimes validity questions can be addressed \nonly for certain subgroups of types. The study by Otis and \nLouks (1997) is one example. \n\nResearch in this area seeks evidence that whole types can \nbe distinguished from each other on the basis of unique \nbchaviors that are not predictable from knowing the four \nseparate preferences composing them. \n\nFor these reasons, validity is achieved cumulatively over \nmany studies addressing different questions. \n\nThere are significant complexities and resources needed \nto compare the 16 types in a single study. For this reason, \nresearchers examining differences among whole types have \noften been unable to contrast all 16 types. 5mall sample \nsizes, limited hypotheses or research questions, and the dif- \n[crential attraction of types to field settings are constraints \nserving to limit the number of whole types that have been \ncompared. In summary, in the studies below, only the \nresults relevant to differences among whole type are empha- \nsized. Data and questions that address other issues are not \ndiscussed, even when they constituted the primary purpose \nof the study. \n\nAnalysis of Type Distributions Type distributions are the \nbasic method for presenting MBTI data on groups. A type \ntable is sometimes seen as providing merely descriptive \n\ninformation, to be followed by more sophisticated analyses. \nOn the contrary, type tables themselves provide evidence for \nconstruct validity. For example, if the type table for a given \noccupation has significantly more of the types predicted by \ntheory to have interest in, and therefore be more likely to \nbe members of, that occupation, then the type table \ncontributes to construct validity. \n\nThe method primarily used to analyze type distributions \nis the self-selection ratio type table (SRTT) analysis \n(McCaulley, 1985). This is followed by a chi-square test of",

    "content": "the contingency table of interest. SRTT can be used to test \nhow the frequency of a type in an occupation compares \nwith the frequency of that type in a relevant base popula- \ntion; it provides an index of the magnitude ol over- or \nunderrepresentation ol a given type or preference in a group \nor occupation. The numerator of the ratio is the percentage \nol that type in the occupation; the denominator is the per- \ncentage of that type in the base population. The ratio will be \nexactly 1.00 when the tvpe is found in an occupation in \nexactly the same proportion as it is found in the base popu- \nlation. It will be greater than 1.00 when that type is overrep- \nresented and less than 1.00 when that type is underrepre- \nsented. Thus a ratio of 2.00 indicates that about twice as \nmany individuals of that type are found in the occupation \nas would be expected given the frequency of that type in the \nbase population. Likewise, a ratio of 0.50 indicates that \nabout half as many of that type are found in the occupation \nas would be expected by chance. \n\nTo apply a statistical test to these data a contingency table \nis created and subjected to a chi-square test. Thus the proba- \nbility that the frequency of a given type, preference, or any \ngroup of preferences occurs by chance can be determined. \nThere are two cautions when using this method, however. \nOne is that in the traditional procedure, comparisons of all \n16 types and many different preferences are performed. \nWith this many statistical tests, there is increased risk that \nsome of the significant chi-square values will have occurred \nby chance. The second caution is that the chi-square statistic \nitself is very sensitive to sample size. With very large sam- \nples, as is often the case with the base population, very \nsmall differences can be found to be statistically significant. \nUsers of this technique should then ask whether the results \nare also practically significant. Examples of analyzing type \ntables using the SRTT method can be found in Chapters 11 \nand 12 of this manual and in Hammer (19962). The Myers- \nBriggs Type Indicator Atlas of Type Tables (Macdaid, McCaul- \nley, &amp; Kainz, 1986) provides hundreds of type tables show- \ning the distribution of types in various occupations. \n\nAnother technique, log linear analysis, can also be used \nto analyze type distributions and draw inferences about \nconstruct validity. O'Shea and Mamchur (1989) demon- \nstrate how log linear models can be analyzed to test the pre- \ndictions of type theory about occupational distributions. \nMcCaulley, Macdaid, and Magidson (1997) have also \napplied log linear analysis to type distributions and offer a \n\ngraphical display of the frequency of the types in a sample to \nthe frequency in a base population. One of the advantages of \nthe log linear method is that different models can be fit to the \ntype distribution and then tested statistically. For example, a \nmain effects model would predict that the distributions are a \nfunction of the four independent preference scales, with no \ninteraction among them, while a saturated model attrib- \nutes the distributions to the 16 types, that is, to the interac- \ntion of the preferences. Another advantage is that when test- \ning various models, the technique controls for the effects of \nthe other type characteristics that are not being tested. \n\nEvidence to support the construct validity of the MBTI \nbased on type table distributions is abundant and com- \npelling, particularly in the area of occupational choice. The \npreponderance of data show that the distribution of types \nacross occupations generally follows theoretical predic- \ntions. These findings have been observed (a) across sub- \ngroups within an occupation, (b) across tasks within an \norganization, and (c) across occupations in a different cul- \nture using a translation of the MBTI. \n\nAttraction and Satisfaction Among Couples \n\nResearch Question This study by Marioles, Strickert, and \nHammer (1996) addressed two questions. The first was \nwhether married and engaged couples are more likely to be \nof the same or similar type, or whether they are more likely \nto be of opposite or dissimilar types. The second question \nasked whether there was any relationship between type and \nsatisfaction with marital or premarital relationships. \n\nSample and Methad The sample consisted of 271 couples \nbeing seen in conjoint therapy and 155 couples who were \nnot in therapy. Both of these groups comprised married and \npremarital couples. Ages ranged from 17 to 79, with an aver- \nage of 36; duration of marriage ranged from 0 to 47 years, \nwith a mean of 11 years. Fighty-three percent of the sample \nwere Caucasian, 15% were Hispanic, and 2% were Black. \n\nInstruments Form J of the MBTI was used to determine type \npreferences as well as scores on the 27 subscales of the Type \nDifferentiation Indicator.

However, the discrepancies between \npartners' satisfaction ratings suggested the uscfulness of an \nindex of satisfaction.

On the other hand, \nif the obliviousness index for each type is produced only by \nthe summative effects of the separate preferences of the \ntypes, then the indexes and the type rankings should be \nstrongly similar across types having similar preferences. \n\nThe simplest and clearest test of these two competing \nexplanations is to consider the types that are ranked highest \nand lowest in obliviousness and compare them to similar \ntypes that differ by only one letter. Table 9.26 shows such \ndata for the types ranked highest in obliviousness among \nmen and women. Here we see INTPs are the most oblivious \namong men, with an index of 33 (rank of 1). The four most \nsimilar types are INTJ, INFP ISTP, and ENTP. However, \ntheir mean index is only 5.5; their mean rank is 12.5. \nAlthough it is normally meaningless to average ranks, in \nthis case the mean rank is being used as an indicator of how \nclose the four similar types are to the highest ranked type. \n\nAmong women, ENFJs are the most oblivious, with an",

Their ranks, \nthen, appear to derive from their unique typological charac- \nteristics, i.e., from characteristics that are not explainable by \nthe summative effects of the separate preferences. \n\nObliviousness in this study refers to the percentage of \na given type who are satisfied with their relationship while \ntheir partner is not. In general, more men than women \ntended to indicate they were satisfied with their relation- \nship when their partner was not. However, there were some \nmajor differences by type within the two sexes. \n\nAmong men, INTPs and INFJs had the largest percentage \nwho said they were satisfied when their partners were not. \nAmong women, ENFJs and ENFPs were ranked highest in \nobliviousness. Yet these type rankings were virtually \nreversed among the sexes. Among women, INTPs and INFJs \nwere among the least oblivious. Among men, ENFPs and \nENFJs were located near the bottom of the obliviousness \nrankings. This pattern of results suggests that at least for \nINTPs and INFJs, and for ENFPs and ENFJs, there may be \nsome major differences between men and women in their \nexperience of intimate relationships. \n\nMoreover, the differences between the highest- (Table \n9.26) and lowest- (Table 9.27) ranked types for men and \nwomen provide additional evidence that the results are dis- \nplaying typological effects. First, there appear to be basic sex \ndifferences in obliviousness. The mean index for women \n(averaged across the 16 types, not across the total number of \nwomen) is 5.6, while that for men is 14.1. This is consistent \nwith Gilligans observation that women are more attentive to \nrelationship issues than men are (Gilligan, 1982). Second, \nthere are major differences between men and women as to \nwhere types are ranked. The two most oblivious types for \nmen (INTP and INFJ) have indexes of 0 for women.

The \nmean age of the study sample was 46.9 years and ages ranged \nfrom 30 to 70 years. The majority of the men had multiple \n\nDSM-III-R or DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses; 70% had a diagnosis \nof substance abuse or dependence. Data were collected at \nintake assessment, shortly after admission to the domiciliary, \nand during the early psychotherapy sessions. Except for \nENFPs, the sample consisted primarily of Introverts. Only \ndata for the 158 Introverts in the sample were analyzed. \n\nInstruments Data included the Shipley Institute of Living \nSeale, the original Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inven- \ntory ^ (MMPI), a clinical interview, and the MBTI Form F or \nG. A variety of demographic variables were obtained from \nease records. \n\nAnalysis The Wiggins Content Seales of the MMPI were fac- \ntor analyzed, with two factors emerging, which were named \nSubjeetive Distress and Rebelliousness. An ANOVA was per- \nformed on subjects scores on these factors, using age as a \ncovariate and the four MBTI dichotomies as independent \nvariables. A salienee analysis of the ease record variables was \nperformed in whieh the mean, median, mode, and variance \nfor each type were compared with those of a large number of \nrandom samples taken from the total pool of scores. Depend- \ning on what proportion of the random sample scores is \nhigher or lower than that for given types, the results for \ngiven types ean be interpreted as being significantly different \nfrom the scores of the other types in the sample. Due to small \nsample sizes, some DSM diagnostie categories were col- \nlapsed to yield larger groups. \n\nResults The ANOVA using MMPI factor scores as depen- \ndent variables showed significant main effects due to T-F \nand J-P and no significant interaction terms. Differences \namong the DSM diagnoses for the Introverted types compos- \ning the sample are shown in Table 9.28.

Among Axis II diagnoses, ITPs were most \nlikely to display antisocial and avoidant personality disor- \nders, and ISTJs were most likely to be designated obsessive- \ncompulsive, while IFJs were most likely to be characterized \nas dramatic. \n\nAnalysis of life history variables, shown in Table 9.29, \nfound that ITPs were most likely to have been charged with \na crime unrelated to substance abuse and to have discipli- \nnary problems at the domiciliary. ISTPs were most likely to \nhave never married, while INTPs and ISFPs were least \nlikely to have never married. INTPs tended to have a greater \nnumber of marriages than any other type, while ISTJs had \nthe fewest. ISJs tended to stay in the same job longer than \nthe other types, while INFJs and INTPs had the shortest \nmean time in their jobs. \n\nSummary and Interpretation Two things stand out clearly \nin this study. The first is that the ANOVA found the main \neffeets but none of the interactions to be significant. As \nmentioned above, ANOVA interaction terms alone are lim- \nited in their ability to detect whole type differences. The \nsecond major outcome is the finding of distinct differences \nbetween whole types in terms of diagnoses and life history \nvariables. A close look at Table 9.28 for diagnoses and Table \n9.29 for life history shows that differences between types \nare not just due to the summative effects of the separate",

Among the patterns revealing whole type \ndifferences are the following: \n\nB INTPs and ISTPs were almost identical in their Axis II \nprofiles and in their crime and domestic trouble histories. \nTaken by themselves, these findings could be interpreted \nas the separate effects of the preferences shared between \nINTPs and ISTPs: Introversion, Thinking, and Perceiving. \nHowever, none of the other Introverted, Thinking, or Per- \nceiving types appear to share these effects. Consequently, \nthe outcomes we see with INTPs and ISTPs seem to derive \nfrom the interactive combination of these preferences \nrather than their separate summative effects. It is the \n\ninteractive combination of the Introverted, Thinking, \nand Perceiving preferences that creates the unique char- \nacteristics that are associated with dominant introverted \nThinking. More importantly, these two types are opposite \nin never married status, and INTPs had the highest \nmean number of marriages of any of the types. One \nmight argue that the S-N difference accounts for their \nopposite scores on never married.\" But this interpreta- \ntion fails because one Sensing type, ISFP, was also least \nlikely to be *never married.\" \n\nB INTJs were significantly more likely than any other type \n\nto be diagnosed with major depression, while INFPs \nwere most likely to receive the diagnosis of anxiety dis- \norder. These differences are clearly specific to each of \nthese types. None of the other types had significant pro- \nfiles involving these diagnoses. \n\nBM ISFJs and ISTJs had the two highest means on job length. \n\nTwo Intuitive types, INFJ and INTP, had the lowest \nmeans on this variable. The difference is not just an S-N \ndifference, however, because two other Intuitive types \nand two other Sensing types were not distinguished from \neach other on this measure. ISF]s and ISTJs are domi- \nnant introverted Sensing types. The joh length variable \nappears to be picking up a significant aspect of this par- \nticular pattern of type dynamics. Yet these two types are \nclearly distinguished from each other by their profiles on \nAxis II diagnoses and their means on threc additional life \nhistory variables. \n\nThe analyses in this study that relied on quantitative \n(numerically scored) data really did not reveal much about \nsome of the truly profound differences in how people of dif- \nferent types can exhibit dysfunctional behavior. The impor- \ntant. differences among the types were found mainly by \nlooking at the diagnostic categories, which are qualitative \nmeasurements. Quantitative measures assume that what is \nimportant to know about the person is already contained in \n structured measurement tool (such as the MMPI). Quali- \ntative measures, on the other hand, depend on a much more \nopen-ended exploration and discovery process that takes \nplace during an interview by a skilled clinician.

Used with permission \n\nchecked each adjective that applied to the person they were \nassessing. Between 8 and 16 raters independently rated \neach participant using the ACL. Ratings for assessees were \nstandardized to a base of 10 observers. Ratings for each per- \nson on each ACL item thus could range from 0 to 10, and \ninterjudge reliability was .76. None of the raters knew the \ntypes ol the people they were assessing. Thus their ratings \nwerc completely naive with respect to type. This is a crucial \npoint for interpreting the findings summarized below. \n\nAnalysis The authors present tables listing the 10 most and \n10 least common adjectives associated with the MBTI types. \nBecause the emphasis in this review is on evidence for whole \ntype differences, their data were reanalyzed. From the origi- \nnal tables listing the 10 most and least common adjectives \nassociated with each type, the number of unique adjectives \nfor each type has been counted. These counts are an indica- \ntor of the degree to which each type was seen as different bv \nindependent observers who did not know the types of the \npeople they were rating. The authors stated they had suffi- \ncient numbers to interpret the results for 10 of the 16 types. \nData are thus presented for the following types: INFP, INFJ, \nINTP INTJ, IST], ENFP, ENF], ENTP ENT], and EST]. \n\nResults Thorne and Gough's data showed that, as we would \nexpect, types sharing several preferences tended more often \nto be described with the same adjectives. Types sharing one \nor no preferences tended to be described with very few ol \nthe same adjectives. Table 9.30 and Table 9.31 present the \nnumber of unique adjectives used by raters to describe \n\n216 Research \n\nmales and females of the 10 types for which sufficient data \nwere available. When examining the last column in Table \n9.30 and Table 9.31, it is important to remember that the \nmaximum number of unique adjectives that can be associ- \nated with each type in these tables is 20 because Thorne \nand Gough reported only the 10 most frequently checked \nadjectives for their most descriptive\" and \"least deserip- \ntive\" categories. \n\nSummary and Interpretation These results show that even \ntypes sharing several preferences are seen as noticeably dif- \nferent by independent observers who do not know the \ntypes of the people they are describing. These data reveal \nquite pronounced differences between the types. The mini- \nmum number of unique descriptors lor a single type ranged \nfrom 12 for female ESTJs to a maximum of 20 for INFP \nfemales. The average number of unique descriptors for \nmales was 14.7, and for females it was 16.0. \n\nThese results are especially significant because they \nillustrate what is possible when measurement is not con- \nstrained by using a narrow scale covering limited content. \nThe ACL offers a great variety of qualitative descriptors that \ncan be used to assess subtle differences in type behavior and \nis thus able to detect differences spanning an array of \ndiverse qualities. This helps to put the differences between \nwhole types into sharp relief. In fact, while the numbers of \nunique descriptors shown for each type in the tables is \nimpressive, the differences in content of these unique adjec- \ntives is even more so. The reader is referred to Thorne and \nGough (1991) for a listing of these adjectives for each type. \n\nWhen observers used the 300-word Adjective Check List \nto describe IPAR program participants, their ratings \nshowed a keen sensitivity to type differences, even though \nthey did not know the types of people they rated. For \nexample, among males, ESTJs were described as practical, \nfrivolous, opportunistic, boastful, tough, outgoing, smug, \nsteady, self-confident, and unscrupulous. Male ENTJs were \ndescribed as ambitious, planful, responsible, practical, \nthorough, cowardly, discreet, foresighted, industrious, and \nreliable. These are the two dominant extraverted Thinking \ntypes. In terms of single preferences, they differ only on the \nS-N dichotomy. Yet among the 10 adjectives most fre- \nquently used to describe both types, raters saw them as hav- \ning onlv practicality in common. Male INTPs (dominant \nintroverted Thinking) were seen as original, imaginative,",

Male INTJs \n(auxiliary extraverted Thinking) were seen as formal, delib- \nerate, logical, retiring, serious, aloof, methodical, painstak- \ning, thorough, and reserved. Virtually all other pairs of \ntypes were described in equally diverse terms. When stud- \nies use Instruments with a sufficiently broad content, even \nraters naive to type can clearly see and describe differences \namong people of different types. \n\nDifferences in Observed and Self-Reported \nCharacteristics of Types \n\nResearch Question Pearman and Fleenor (1996) designed a \nstudy to test whether the 16 types differ significantly from \neach other on observer ratings and self-report. \n\nSample and Method The sample consisted of 2,398 man- \nagers and leaders who attended programs at the Center for \nCreative Leadership between 1985 and 1994. Using a large \ndatabase, 150 persons of each type were randomly selected \nfor analysis, although for two types, only 149 cases were \navailable. Most of the sample were White males between 40 \nand 55 years old. Their average tenure in a managerial or \nexecutive position was eight years. Most were United States \ncitizens, and the majority were from the private economic \nsector. \n\nInstruments The two instruments used for testing type dif- \nferences were the Leadership Style Indicator (LS1) and the \nCalifornia Psychological Inventory (CPI). The CPI yields \nscores on 20 standardized scales. The LSI contains 48 \nadjectives used by observers to rate others. The individuals \nbeing rated also rated themselves on the same 48 adjectives \nin the LSI. \n\nAnalysis The 20 scales of the CPI were analyzed as depen- \ndent variables in ANOVAs, with MBTI type as the indepen- \ndent variable. An ANOVA was also performed using the LSI \nscales as dependent variables. The Duncan Multiple Range \nlest was used post hoc to determine the ordering of types \non the dependent variables. \n\nResults The ANOVAs by type were significant for all CPI \nscales and for 24 of the LSI scales. However, when type is \nused as the independent variable in an ANOVA, a signifi- \ncant effect tells us only that the mean for at least one type \nwas significantly different from the means for one or more \nother types; a significant F-test does not necessarily indicate \nthat the means of all 16 types differed from one another. \nResults of multiple comparison tests were not reported, so \nthere is no way of knowing whether all 16 types were signif- \nicantly different from every other type on at least one of the \nCPI or LSI scales. Evidence of such differences is required \nfor validation of whole types. \n\nHowever, the authors did report a hybrid analysis that \nincorporated both qualitative and quantitative differences. \nThev compared all 16 types with respect to the scales on \nwhich the types scored highest. The result was a profile of \nthe most important scales for each type that revealed how \neach type is characterized by the CPI or the LSI. The pro- \nfiles based on each instrument showed that the types all \ndiffered from one another. While this kind of analysis does \nnot yield the precision of more sophisticated statistical \n\ntechniques, its advantage is in avoiding a narrow focus on \npurely quantitative results that too often obscures impor- \ntant differences in the qualities that distinguish the 16 types. \n(The results of this study are discussed in more detail in \nChapter 13 in this manual.) \n\nSummary and Interpretation The self-reported evaluations \nconsistently varied by type. Furthermore, each type could \nbe characterized by a combined CPI and LS! profile that \nmatched the predictions of type theory and Myers type \ndescriptions. For example, type theory predicts that ETs are \nlikely to be more dominant in social behavior than any \nother type, and ENTJs had the highest score on dominance. \nThe theory would also predict that ISFPs would score low- \nest on dominance, which they did. This study also found \nthat all 16 types had scores in the normal t-score range on \nthe CPI. From this the authors conclude that the MBTI \nmeasures normal and stable personality characteristics for \n16 types. Furthermore, within these normal score ranges, \nall 16 types can be distinguished from one another in ways \npredicted by type theory. \n\nType and Time Orientation Harrison and Lawrence \n(1985) studied the time orientation of middle school \nstudents (N = 302). The students were asked to write \nscenarios about their personal futures, being free to decide \nhow far ahead their description would extend. Based on \nprevious theoretical work by Mann, Siegler, and Osmond \n(1968, 1971), the authors hypothesized that Intuitive types \nwould be oriented toward the future; Thinking types would \nhave a linear perspective incorporating the future, \npresent, and past; Sensing types would be oriented toward \nthe present; and Feeling types would focus more on the",

Using these hypotheses ahout time orientation, and \nconsidering the dominant and auxiliary status of the \nfunctions for each type, the authors hypothesized a rank \nordering of types based on how long into the future the \nscenarios of each type were predicted to extend. \n\nTable 9.32 compares the observed with the predicted \nresults. These findings are particularly impressive because \nthe predicted rank ordering of types in the upper half of \nthe table is based on typological criteria, which predicts a \ndiflerent ordering than does the strictly linear or trait crite- \nria used in the bottom half of the table. The differences \nbetween the two sets of predicted ranks illustrate that the \ntypological predictions do not reflect a simple additive \ncombination of the S-N and T-F dichotomies.

Lawrence, 1985, Journal of Psychological Type, 9, p 11 Copyright 1985 by \nJournal of Psychological Type Used with permission \n\n218 Research \n\nFrom the trait perspective only the additive effects of the \npreferences are important. The S-N dichotomy is most \nsalient for time orientation, with Intuitive types predicted \nto have a longer frame of reference than Sensing types. The \nT-F dichotomy is second in importance, with Thinking \ntypes assumed to have a longer frame of reference than \nFecling types. The summative predicted ordering in the sec- \nond table is thercfore NT  NF  ST  SE From the trait per- \nspective, all Intuitive types are predicted to rank first, fol- \nlowed by all Sensing types. Within the Intuitive and Sensing \ntypes, the linear ordering would then rank Thinking types \nabove Feeling types. While the authors did not discuss the \nrankings predicted by this kind of linear analysis, these \nrankings are shown in the second part of Table 9.32 for \ncontrast with predictions made by type theory. As illus- \ntrated, the linear model lumps the types together in groups \nof four because it considers only the S-N and T-F prefer- \nences in determining ranks. \n\nThe correlations of the trait predictions and the typologi- \ncal predictions with the obscrved rankings were .88 and .98, \nrespectively. Both correlations are significant at p &lt; .OOl. \nNevertheless, a visual comparison of the actual and prce- \ndicted rankings, as well as the difference in the sizes ol \nthese coefficients, makes it clear that the typological predic- \ntions are much closer to the observed rankings than are the \nlincar predictions. This is because the linear model fails to \naccount for characteristics that are important in under- \nstanding a persons orientation to time. These characteris- \nties are accounted for by type theory. More such studies that \ncontrast the two eompeting explanationstype versus \ntrait would be invaluable. \n\nCorrelations with Factor Scores Derived from Other \nMeasures Mitchell (1981) reported on data from 475 bank \ncmployees at all levels of the organization in a study \nconcerned with the social climate of the organization.

A number of exploratory \nlactor analyses of the MBTI scales have demonstrated very \nclose correspondence with the hypothesized four-factor \nstructure. More rigorous confirmatory factor analyses pro- \nvide even stronger support for the model. Correlations of \nthe four preferences scales with a wide variety of scales \nfrom other instruments support the predictions of type the- \nory regarding the meaning of and the behaviors believed to \nbe associated with the four dichotomies. Evidence for the \ndichotomous nature of the scales was seen in plots of pref- \nerence scores against external variables. Analysis of these \nplots demonstrated that the only significant differences \nbetween successive groups of scores were exactly at the",

Other \nstudies of behavioral differences, including studies of cre- \nativity, differences in orientation to time, fantasy and \nimagery, desire for privacy, optimism, and anxiety also gen- \nerally support the theoretical definitions of the scales. \n\nFor the first time, evidence has been accumulated to \naddress the question of the validity of whole types and of \ntype dynamics theory. Some of the research presented in this \nsection is based on original analyses of the national sample \ndata collected for this revision. This section reflects the \nemphasis throughout this manual on whole types and type \ndynamics. Evidence presented here on type distributions, \nattraction and satisfaction in couples, reactions to stress, and \nfactor scores derived from other measures suggests that \nthere are characteristics of whole types that are not pre- \ndictable from knowledge of the individual preferences alone \nor from simple additive models of the preferences. Descrip- \ntions of the types based on self-reports and on ratings by \nindependent ohservers also show that each of the 16 types \ncan be uniquely described with various sets of adjectives and \ndescriptors. A reanalysis of a study of time orientation was \nalso presented that directly compared type theorybased and \ntrait theory-based predictions and showed that the type \ntheorybased predictions were more accurate. \n\nThe applications chapters that follow also present re- \nsearch that is relevant to the validity of the individual pref- \nerence scales and of whole types. Chapter + also contains \nevidence for the validity of the types. Hopefully, the research \npresented in this chapter and elsewhere in this manual on \nthe validity of whole types and on type dynamics will en- \ncourage other researchers to examine these questions. \n\nd \n,  \"Y +65 roe E \n% t re.

Jung also observed \nthese kinds of differences in philosophers, writers, poets, \nand scientists and found evidence for the universality \nof his tvpes across cultures, historical eras, and socio- \neconomic situations. Jungs development and relinement \nof type theory are described in Chapter 3, and examples of \nhis application of the type approach in psychotherapy \nappear throughout his many published works.

In the 1960s, Mendelsohn and his associates \n(Mendelsohn, 1966; Mendelsohn &amp; Geller, 1963, 1965, \n1967, Mendelsohn &amp; Kirk, 1962) reported on students who \nsought counseling at the counseling center of the University \nof California, Berkeley. A 1979 review of the rescarch litera- \nture on counseling applications ( Carskadon, 1979) reported \nmore than 50 studies. The application of the MBTI to coun- \nseling and psychotherapy issues has continued to increase \nover the years. Recent clinical research literature is reviewed \nin Quenk and Quenk (1996). For a rcview of research on \nthe related area of type influences on health, stress, and \ncoping, see Shelton (1996). \n\nThe goal of this chapter is to provide counselors and psy- \nchotherapists with a practical guide to using the MBII instru- \nment in the broad variety of settings in which it is appropri- \nate. The chapter is organized so that readers can readily find \nguidelines relevant to each counseling/psychotherapy issue \nor specific application. Where available, resources for addi- \ntional information are suggested. A brief summary of relevant \nclinical research is included in this chapter.! \n\nAdvantages of a Typological \nApproach to Counseling \nand Psychotherapy \n\nThe standard of normality against which behavior is \njudged tends to depend on the prevailing societal and pro- \nfessional view of mental health and psychological adapta- \ntion. Jungs observation of consistent, nonpathological indi- \nvidual dilferences in his patients casts doubt on such a \nnormative view and provides the most compelling reason \nfor taking type into account in psychotherapy and counsel- \ning settings.  systematic conception of normal personality \ndifferences such as that afforded by psychological type \nenables mental health practitioners to discriminate between \nbehaviors that are normal for one type but may signal dif- \nficulties for another type. For example, we would expect an \nintroverted child to enjoy spending a good deal of time \nalone but might be concerned when we see the same behav- \nior in a typically active, people-oriented Extraverted child; \nan ISTJ who is habitually anxious and cautious about tak- \ning on new projects would be consistent with her type, \nwhile the same behavior in an ENFP would be puzzling; the \naggressive behaviors of an ENTJ and an ISFJ would likely \nhave quite different dynamics and motivations. \nUnderstanding what is natural, comfortable, and valued \nand what is difficult, uncomfortable, and trivial for each of \nthe 16 personality types enables therapists to assess clients \n\nfrom the standpoint of 16 different norms of human \nbehavior. When therapists use this approach, clients are \nmore likely to feel appreciated as individuals characterized \nby legitimate and predictable strengths and frailties. In \navoiding comparing clients with a single norm of mental \nhealth, practitioners are less likely to make inappropriate \ndiagnoses of pathological conditions. They are also less \nlikely to miss subtle signs of psychological or emotional \ndisturbance. For example, ESTJ and ENT] clients can often \nmaintain outward composure and efficiency while experi- \nencing extreme internal confusion and distress. \n\nAdditional advantages of a typological approach are \ndirectly related to using type-based rather than single- \nnorm-based criteria in evaluating and treating clients. A \ntypological approach helps therapists and counsclors in \nthe following ways. \n\nEstablishing Rapport \n\nTherapists who are aware of type differences listen for them, \nform tentative hypotheses, and can communicate under- \nstanding and acceptance of a client quite early in the interac- \ntion. For example, many Introverted clients see their Intro- \nversion as *a problem\" or even as pathological. A therapist \nwho hears this can clearly explain Introversion as a normal \nand adaptive energy preference, giving examples and asking \nthe client questions that are likely to accurately reflect the \nclients feelings and experiences. A couple in marital coun- \nseling who in their report of their disagreements appear to \ndiffer in the Judging versus Perceiving attitude will both feel \nunderstood and affirmed when the counselor accurately \ndescribes the discomfort each experiences with the other's \napproach. Experienced practitioners can use such hypothe- \nses about possible type characteristics with regard to all of \nthe preferences, combinations of preferences, and dynamic \nwhole types. Using type knowledge to aid in establishing \nrapport often occurs before the Indicator has been adminis- \ntered and interpreted, and a practitioner need not use type \n\"language\" to talk with clients about type differences. Once \nthe MBTI has been administered and type verified by the \nclient, practitioners can further enhance rapport through",

    "content": "continued understanding of the clients type perspective. \n\nPromoting Therapist Neutrality \n\nPractitioners tend to listen to clients' presentation of them- \nselves and their difficulties from a more neutral standpoint \nwhen they are aware of the different meanings that may be \nassociated with different type characteristics. They are less \nlikely to interpret a clients style and behavior as disturbed or \nproblematical before evaluating them in the context of the \nclients type. Counselors are also less likely to view the \nclients behavior using the bias of their own type. As Jung \nstated, The greatest mistake an analyst can make is to \nassume that his patient has a psychology similar to his own\" \n(1960, p. 259). \n\nProviding a Nonpathological Language \nfor Discussing Problems \n\nThe underlying premise of type is that each of the opposite \ntype functions and attitudes is valid, necessary, and useful. \nThe careful use of neutral and positive language in describing \nthe opposite preferences is an effort to convey this notion. \nPeople new to type as well as experienced users can attest to \nthe difficulty of avoiding biased and pejorative language in \ndescribing ones opposite type or ones less-preferred type \ncharacteristics. People often come to counseling because of a \nlong period of disconfirmation by others, dissatisfaction \nwith themselves, and a desire to reduce the distress that \nlimits their lives. A positive way of describing difficulties \nthat are associated with type differences can stimulate \nincreased energy, optimism, and cooperation with the ther- \napy process. This in turn can motivate a client with serious \npsychological problems to persist in therapy. In contrast, a \ntherapeutic approach that sees the clients type preferences \nas weaknesses and differences from normal behavior can \nadd to the discouragement and hopelessness that may have \nbrought the person to seck help. \n\nEncouraging Change Based on \nUnderstanding of Differences \n\nPeople typically understand others from the point of view \nof their own type. It is natural for me to assume that my \nfriends or colleagues motives for an action, what she means \nby her words, and what she wants me to do in response to \nher are the same as if I were performing that action, saying \nthose words, or wanting a response. The reality of 16 differ- \nent types makes such assumptions largely untenable. This \nis very likely reflected in the frequency with which clients \nexpress frustration and despair at their difficulties in living \nand working effectively with others. Clients who under- \nstand type differences gain a useful perspective on the \nmeaning of others communications and behaviors. With \ncontinued guidance from the counselor, they can come \ncloser to understanding the meaning of the words and \nactions of a person of a different type. For example, an ESF] \nclient expressed anxiety and concern about losing his job \nbecause his quiet and dispassionate INTP supervisor fre- \nquently pointed out mistakes and gave praise sparingly. The \nclient believed his supervisor was critical, disapproving, \nand dissatisfied with his performance. The counselor \ndescribed and gave the rationale for the natural tendency of \na dominant introverted Thinking type to focus on discrep- \nancies rather than on what is going well. The counselor also \npointed out that for an ESF] to be long on criticism and \nshort on praise would indeed indicate disapproval and dis- \nsatislaction with someones performance. This explanation \nof the natural differences between INTPs and ESFJs helped \nthe client modify his expectations of his supervisor and \nmade him more resilient and effective in his work situation. \n\nUses of Type in Counseling and Psychotherapy 225 \n\nne  \n\nClients can also be helped to take type into account as a \nway of accepting and, if desirable, modifying their own \nbehavior and communications. They may benefit by view- \ning behaviors associated with their own and others' less- \npreferred sides as expected consequences of specializing in \none of each pair of opposites. This can encourage them to \nappreciate rather than disparage differences. For example, \nan ISFJ planning a vacation with an ENFP spouse is more \nlikely to compromise about including unscheduled activi- \nties if her advance planning and attention to the details of \nthe trip are appreciated by the ENFP as helpful rather than \nridiculed as overly controlling and compulsive. \n\nProviding Clients with a Sense of Self-Worth \n\nCounselors have said that what they like most about type is \nthat it gives clients a sense of worth and dignity concerning \ntheir own qualities. Clients can be assured at the beginning \nthat finding out about type, ones own and other peoples, is \na releasing experience, not a restricting one as may have \nbeen feared. Finding out about type frees one to recognize \nones own natural bent and to trust ones own potential for \ngrowth and excellence. There is no obligation or need to be",

As the model is explained, problems and lia- \nbilities can be seen as a neglect of less-preferred functions \nwhile more-preferred ones were being developed. The stage \ncan be set for looking at the clients problems from the per- \nspective of gaining more effective command over both pre- \nferred and nonpreferred functions and attitudes. For exam- \nple, the Intuitive type can see that the dream of the future is \nvaluable but that present realities may have been over- \nlooked and need more attention. The Sensing type may see \nthat the skills of dealing with present realities are valuable \nbut that including Intuition will open up additional practi- \ncal options. \n\nType and the Therapy/ \nCounseling Process \n\nPsychotherapy and counseling are complex endeavors, and \nmany interacting factors influence the process for both prac- \ntitioner and client. Issues such as presenting problems, set- \nting where counseling occurs, referral source, allowable \nnumber of sessions, therapist theoretical orientation, age of \nclient, and myriad other variables may be involved. The \nextent to which knowledge and use of the MBTI are appro- \npriate and helpful will vary in relation to this wide range of \nfactors. Experienced therapists, however, report a continuing \n\n226 Tke Uses of Type \n\nprocess of discovering and capitalizing on the insights and \nrichness type provides in their treatment of clients. \n\nThis section is designed to provide both new and experi- \nenced counselors and psychotherapists with information \nthat they can incorporate and use with clients. Typical \ncounseling issues associated with the individual type prel- \nerences are presented first, followed by the more complex \nand very fruitful area of type dynamics and understanding \nof each of the 16 types. A third topic is effective communi- \ncation given the different communication and language \nstyles of clients and therapists. \n\nCounseling Issues Related to Each \nof the Four Type Dichotomies \n\nThe following descriptions are designed to alert counselors \nto issues frequently associated with each MBTI preference. \nThe information provided can also be useful in helping \nclients appreciate and use both poles of the dichotomies. \nThis can be especially important for clients whose use of a \npreferred attitude or function is one-sided or rigid. Such \nclients can be helped to see the preferences as tools. Part of \nthe counselors task is helping the client recognize which \ntool is needed for a given situation. While it is certainly \nimportant to affirm the clients natural preferences, helping \nclients recognize circumstances more suitable to using their \nless-preferred attitudes and functions can be equally help- \nful. The safety of the counseling situation can encourage \neffective use of possibly neglected poles of the dichotomies. \n\nExtraversion and Introversion (E-I) Issues related to the \nE-I dichotomy focus on the orientation of energy toward \nthe outer world of people, things, and activities (E) or the \nworld of concepts, ideas, and inner experiences (1). \n\nExtraversion Extraverts can, be expected to look outward \nbelore they look inward for an explanation of the events \nthat occur in their lives. They are more likely to initially \nblame others or life circumstances for difficulties than to \ncxamine their own contributions to problems. Extraverts \nalso tend to \n\nB Gain insight more easily after having an experience. \nTherefore counseling sessions arc likely to be devoted to \ndescribing developments of the past week, seeking \nexplanations of past events. \n\nB Become uncomfortable if the counselor is very quiet. \nThey seek active interaction as a verification that they \nhave been heard and may interpret silence and lack of \nactive involvement of the therapist as disapproval and \nrejection. \n\nB Present such an active, competent face (especially E] \ntypes) that it is casy to miss signs of distress and lack of \nconfidence. \n\nB Do  fair amount of talking as a way of arriving at the \npoint of their communication. Counselors should \nview this not as trivial communication or an attempt to \n\navoid important issues but rather as the natural *think- \ning out loud\" style of Extraverts. \n\nSome Extraverts seem to use their auxiliary function as \nwell as their dominant function in the Extraverted attitude. \nThis makes them appear to others as extreme Extraverts \n(see the discussion of auxiliary function issues later in this \nchapter). For Extraverts with this kind of imbalance in their \nuse of energy, the developmental task is balancing their E \nwith their I. They need to learn in small doses to reflect (use \nI) before acting and to gain greater comfort with solitude",

Some Extraverts find they can \nadd Introverted balance to their lives through formal medi- \ntation techniques or simply by making sure to include some \nsolitary time in their daily activities. A major value of coun- \nseling is to help Extraverts slow down and consider their \nbehavior before they act, and then consider it again after \nthey act. \n\nIntroversion Introverts are more likely to look to themselves \nfirst for causes of difficulties rather than to others and the \ncnvironment. They are therefore more intrapunitive than \nextrapunitivc. Introverted clients can be reassured that their \ninstinct to first blame themselves for any difficulties is a \nnatural and expected aspect of their Introverted prefcrence. \nSuch a communication can discourage clients from assum- \ning that their self-blaming tendency itself is a personal fail- \ning. They will then be more able to consider other pcople \nand external circumstances as contributing to misunder- \nstanding and life difficulties. Introverts also tend to \n\n@ Gain experience more easily after they have an internal \nconceptual or experiential framework. Therefore they \nbencfit from comments that help them clarify the con- \ncepts or linkages of past experiences that may be behind \ntheir own behavior. \n\n@ Want to understand what is behind other peoples behav- \nior. Such knowledge makes the environment more \nunderstandable and therefore safer, so that they can \nattempt action. Dominant introverted Thinking clients \n(ISTP and INTP) in particular are often bewildered by \nothers behavior and misinterpret or overinterpret its \nmeaning. \n\n8 Need long pauses during sessions (which may cause dis- \ncomfort to Extraverted counselors) while they clarify \ninternally what has been said or gain the courage to con- \nfide something clse to the counselor. \n\nm Benefit from being encouraged to try new Extraverted \nactivities. The therapist can reassure the client that first \nattempts may be experienced as awkward and uncom- \nfortable but greater case will come with practice. The \ngoal is for the Introvert to develop a comfortable way of \nextraverting as an Introvert rather than extraverting like \nan Extravert. \n\nSome Introverted clients introvert both their dominant \nand auxiliary functions, making them appear as extreme \nIntroverts. A developmental issue for them is to learn to \n\nuse their auxiliary function in dealing with people and the \nExtraverted world. Counselors can encourage this balanc- \ning development by suggesting tasks and activities that \nrequire the client to extravert the auxiliary and at which he \nor she is likely to succeed. Continued success often allows \nthe natural process\" to come into play more actively and \nspontaneously. Introverts benefit from practicing actions \nand outward expression of opinions. \n\nSensing and Intuition (S-N) Issues related to Sensing and \nIntuition involve the opposite ways clients take in informa- \ntion about the world and what they attend to in their imme- \ndiate environment. \n\nSensing In counseling with a Sensing type, issues should be \ndiscussed in specific and concrete terms, using frequent \nexamples that are relevant to the clients life experience and \ncircumstances. Sensing clients typically seek counseling for \na specific, current problem and tend to be disinterested in a \nlengthy psychodynamic exploration of their lives. They ter- \nminate when that problem is resolved. They may return at \nsome later time to obtain help with another specific issue. \nSensing clients are likely to \n\nB See their view of the situation as the only possible one \nand therefore as permanent or a given. The counselor \ncan broaden the clients perspective by describing practi- \ncal alternatives for the client to assess. \n\nB See the alternatives proposed as negative. When Intu- \nition is the inferior function (15] and ESP types), this will \nbe particularly true. The goal of providing positive possi- \nbilities is to teach the client that what is not presently \nknown can be enhancing and not always threatening. \n\nBW Benefit from being taught to recognize and appreciate \nothers intuitions and to put greater trust in their own \nIntuition when Sensing does not provide adequate \nanswers. \n\nTherapeutic strategies that involve being active can be \nhelpful for grounding Sensing types when their trust in and \ncomfort with reality is shaken. Sensing types are often eager \nfor and obtain great benefit from homework exercises that \ninvolve answering specific, factual questions, thinking about \nand assessing past experiences, and trying out new behav- \niors. They may be skeptical and uncooperative when an \nIntuitive counselor suggests interventions that use fantasy \nand imaging techniques. In such situations, Sensing types \nwho also prefer Feeling may be distressed at disappointing \nthe counselor, which can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy. \n\nIntuition Intuitive type clients are likely to use more abstract",

As clients, intuitive types are \n\nlikely to \n\nB Be so caught up in possibilities that they (1) overlook \nthe facts and the limitations facts impose, (2) assume \nthey already know all the facts, or (3) assume that facts \nare unimportant. A counselor may need 10 push Intu- \nitive clients 10 turn on their Sensing to assess the practi- \ncal steps needed to turn their possibilities into realities. \n\n@ Be independent and see many interesting connections in \nthe process of discussing themselves. Counselors will do \nwell to let them find their own solutions with a mini- \nmum of direction. \n\nB Focus on new possibilities and iake the position that \nthere must be an answer if they look long enough. This \nstance can provide hope and optimism in treatment, but \na counselor may need to ask whether the clients energy \nmight be better spent on goals for which more immedi- \nate possibilities offer needed solutions. \n\nIntuitive type clients enjoy and are often adept at inter- \nventions that make use of fantasy and the exploration of \npsychological connections. They may be resistant to more \nfactual and systematic approaches and disappointed in and \ncritical of counselors who promote them. Such clients may \nassume that the counselor does not understand the com- \nplexity and uniqueness of the clients personality. \n\nThinking and Feeling (TF) Issues related to decision \nmaking and the general way of evaluating perceptions and \ncommunications involve the dilference between Thinking \nand Feeling. \n\nThinking A Thinking type is naturally skeptical and critical \nand can be expected to be so in the counseling session. A \ncounselor therefore should be prepared to back up his or \nher statements with evidence. Thinking types may also \n\nW Disregard what matters to them (Feeling issues) because \nIt isnt logical to care so much. At some stage, it is \nimportant for them to accept and integrate their values \nand feelings as valid and deserving of respect. They often \ndo this by including Feeling considerations into their \nlogical, cause-and-effect analyses. \n\nB Not find it useful to be asked to describe feelings. It is \nalso not appropriate to label Thinking types as defen- \nsive or \"intellectualizing\" when they have trouble \nputting feelings into words, or when their words for feel- \nings sound stereotypical or analytical. \n\n8 Have issues about discomfort and a sense of inadequacy \nin social situations, as they tend to take longer than \nother types to develop comfortable social skills. This is \nparticularly true for dominant introverted Thinking \ntypes (ISTP and INTP). Social skills training with easy \nexercises can be useful when the client sees the logic of \nlearning these skills and when they will enable desired \nrelationships or activities. \n\n228 The Uses of Type \n\nClients who preter Thinking can benefit Irom achieving \nsome comfortable ways of expressing approval and appreci- \nation of others. The counselor should be careful not to \nexpect the Thinking type to initially do this with finesse \nand skill and would do well to recommend low-key, non- \nemotive approaches. People who prefer Thinking usually \nhave fewer words to describe and discriminate among their \nown feelings as well as to identify others expression ol feel- \ning. During the process of counseling or psychotherapy, \nsuch clients can be helped to identify and make discrimina- \ntions in this sometimes puzzling area. \n\nFeeling Clients who prefer Feeling benefit from clarifying \ntheir values and discussing choices between short-term and \nlong-term goals. They are likely to seek approval and affir- \nmation from the therapist and may be reluctant to state \ntheir needs and desires directly. In addition, they may \n\nB Ignore unpleasant facts that conflict with their values. \nThev can profit from gentle confrontations with these \ndiscrepant facts. At times a counselors straightforward \ninterpretations can be taken as harsh criticism. \n\nB Become negative and cynical when their goals and val- \nues have been undermined or ignored. This is especially \ndetrimental in types in which Fceling is dominant (EF) \nand IFP). Finding a new and caring connection or \nemphasizing good current relationships can be helpful \nin tempering a cynical attitude. \n\nWB Hesitate to state their wishes clearly and assume that \nother people ought to know their desires without being \ntold. It is useful to point out that Thinking types may not \nknow what matters to another person and it is unkind to",

At times, however, \nthev may devote so much energy to other people's needs \nthat they have insufficient time for themselves. Care should \nbe taken not to automatically *diagnose\" their behavior as \nunhealthy or codependent. It can be a slow process to \nhelp Feeling types balance the nurturance that is intrinsic \nand satisfying for them against legitimate attention to their \nown desires. \n\nJudging and Perceiving (J-P) Judging and Perceiving are \nrelevant when clients have concerns about organizing and \ncontrolling their lives or about adapting and being open to \nlile experiences. \n\nJudging People with a Judging preference bring issues relat- \ning to control and authority into sessions. They may be \nuncomfortable with the therapy process if they perceive it \nas requiring them to give up control to the therapist. Judg- \ning types, especially those who also prefer Sensing, are most \ncomfortable when clear goals and timelines arc laid out at \n\nthe outset of therapy. Clients who prefer Judging are also \nlikely to \n\nB Find adapting to change stressful, especially when their \nprevious strategies have proven ineffective. It can be help- \nful to have Judging types let go of control for a limited time \nor in a limited arca. The client can plan to be flexible. \n\nB benefit from being taught strategies for using Perception \nto understand their own or other peoples behavior. Judg- \ning clients can be taught to ask questions where they \nthink they already have answers. For example, \"My son is \nbad because he . . . becomes Why do you suppose he \ndoes...?\" \n\nW Take the counselors expressed hypotheses, suggestions, \nand interpretations as final judgments rather than as the \nexploration of possibilities. Frequently emphasizing the \ntentative nature of the counselors statements is therefore \nimportant. \n\nThe counselor can help Judging types avoid premature \nclosure by asking them to think about other possibilities \nand facts that could be relevant and to define a period of \ntime when they decide not to decide. Judging type clients \noften feel affirmed by the counselors recognition of their \nnatural discomfort with lack of closure. They may then be \nmore willing to stay open to their preferred form of percep- \ntion (Sensing or Intuition) and thus tolerate a delay in final \ndecision making. \n\nPerceiving Types who have a Perceiving preference, espe- \ncially younger clients, often report problems related to dis- \ntractibility, procrastination, and difficulty meeting deadlines \nand organizing their time effectively. In addition, they may \n\nBl See even modest structure as unduly restricting, especially \nif their preference for Perceiving is very clear and consis- \ntent. Behavior that can seem irresponsible to others may \nbe seen by the client as a valuable exercise of freedom. \n\nB Benefit from considering the consequences of their \napproach. Thinking Perceiving clients can learn the use \nof Judging skills by considering the negative conse- \nquences of not coming to closure or being late. Feeling \nPerceiving clients can consider the harm they may be \ndoing to others by not coming to closure. \n\nB Be able to moderate their approach by examining what \nhappens when they have difficulties with decision mak- \ning and asking themselves what facilitates or blocks \ndecisions for them. A client can be taught time manage- \nment or similar Judging skills, but it is usually more useful \nto mobilize the energy of the decision-making functions, \nThinking and Feeling, to understand and overcome \nblocks to decision making. \n\nPeople who prefer to extravert the perceiving functions of \nSensing or Intuition can be helped to come to closure by \nbeing asked to consider how likely it is that they will make \nthe wrong decision given the amount of information they \nhave. For Intuitive Perceiving types overwhelmed with too \nmany options, practice in collecting facts will often eliminate \n\nmost options as impractical and make their choices man- \nageable. Help in breaking up a large project into smaller, \nmorc managcable pieces can also be beneficial. \n\nCounseling Issues Related to \nType Dynamics and Development \n\nType theory leads us to expect greater comfort, confidence, \nand facility when individuals most conscious functions, the \ndominant and auxiliary, are directing their lives. We expect \ncorrespondingly greater discomfort, insecurity, and inepti- \ntude when the inexperienced, relatively unconscious tertiary \nand inferior functions are being used. This expected dynamic \nis predictable in a system that assumes specialization of \nopposite pairs of mental functions and attitudes. However, \nclients who are experiencing psychological and emotional \ndistress may not conlorm to this hypothesized dynamic",

The clients type development may be at issuc \nthere may be one or more ways in which the persons tvpe \nis undifferentiatedor there may be no clear and consistent \npreference for either pole of one or more of the dichotomies. \nFor example, if neither Sensing nor Intuition is the habitual \nway of perceiving, the person may alternately attend to pres- \nent data and shift to future possibilities in a haphazard man- \nner; his or her resulting awareness of the world may diverge \nfrom that of others in an unpredictable way. This kind of lack \nol dilferentiation may significantly contribute to the clients \npresenting complaints. For further discussion of undifferen- \ntiated functions, sce Quenk (198542). \n\nAlternatively (or in addition), nontypological factors may \nbe the major source of the clients difficulties. We can expect \ngeneral psychological impairment to have an impact on type \nfunctioning. Where general impairment seems to be re- \nflected or expressed in inadequate type functioning, the \ntherapist may be able to address the issue from the neutral \nand affirming perspective of type dynamics. To expand on \nthe example above of a person with an undifferentiated Per- \nceiving function, such a client may be seen as somewhat \neccentric and even paranoid because he or she tends to \nfocus on a few concrete facts and move quickly to a global \ntheory that connects those facts in an idiosyncratic way. The \ntherapist can describe such paranoia to the client as a dif- \nhiculty in choosing which kind of perception is most appro- \npriate in a given situation, rather than as a serious \"thought \ndisorder. Strategies to help the client notice and differenti- \nate the two kinds of perception can then be adopted as a \ntherapeutic approach. Thus, therapists and counselors who \nare alert to evidence of dynamic and devclopmental signs \ncan capitalize on this knowledge in formulating and imple- \nmenting individualized treatment of the client. \n\nCautions in Making Inferences \nAbout Type Dynamics \nTherapists and counselors should bear in mind that type the- \n\nory and the MBTI inventory address individual differences in \nnormal personality functioning, not psychopathological or \n\nUses of Type in Counseling and Psychotherapy 229 \n\ndiagnostic categories as might be clicited in such instru- \nments as the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory \n(MMPI). Isabel Myers observed that some people were able \nto use their type more effectively than others, and experi- \nence certainly bears this out. Clients secking counscling \nand psychotherapy are likely to be Jess effective in their \nexpression of their type. A knowledgeable practitioner can \ncapitalize on this in treating them. However, the following \ncautions apply in assessing possible dynamic problems: \n\nm Dynamic and developmental issues can sometimes be \nhypothesized during the sessions devoted to explaining \nand verifying the clients type. However, case or difficulty \nin verifying a best-fit type are not by themselves indica- \ntive of the absence or presence of type-relevant prob- \nlems. A more fruitful approach is to attend to possible \ndeviations from the \"expected\" dynamics of the client's \nverihed or hypothesized type. \n\nm Pcople often experience as abnormal the normal \ncharacteristics of types who are different from them- \nselves, especially when appraising theit opposite type. \nCounselors and therapists need to exercise particular \nvigilance in this regard. For example, an INT] therapist \nmust remind herself that the gregariousness and focus \non sensual pleasure of an ESFP are natural expressions \nof typc, not evidence of a narcissistic personality disor- \nder; an ENFP counselor should resist viewing his oppo- \nsite IST] client as obsessive-compulsive. Similar cautions \napply for all pairs of therapist and client types. \n\nm When a client is the same type as the therapist, the thera- \npist may miss significant dynamic difficulties because \nwhat the client describes feels familiar and natural. The \ntherapist may overlook evidence that the clients use of \ntype is ineffective, perhaps viewing the difficulty as situ- \national and external. \n\nIdentifying the Dynamics of Type Development \n\nThe MBTI provides a therapeutic model that builds on nat- \nural strengths before dealing with the weaknesses of less \ndeveloped aspects of a clients typological makeup. Discov- \nering the clients strengths and reinforcing them is therefore \nessential. The goal of this section is to help practitioners \nidentify effective use of type as well as signs of possible \ndynamic and developmental difficulties. Where appropri- \nate, strategies for treatment in dealing with these issues arc \nsuggested. \n\nAssessment of the Dominant Function Since the \ndominant function in theory gives direction and is the most \ntrustworthy, the counselor should listen for evidence that \nthe dominant function is indeed trusted and giving \ndirections. If the dominant function is Sensing, does the",

The assumption is that \nrelying on well-differentiated, trustworthy functions will \nlead to more positive outcomes and a greater sense ol \nautonomy for the individual. \n\nSerious consideration should be given to any dilficulties \nan individual is having in the aspects of life related to the \ndominant function. For example, impracticality in a Sens- \ning type is more serious than impracticality in an Intuitive \ntype since realism should be an essential characteristic of \nthose who prefer Sensing perception. Habitual concern \nabout hurting others feelings may be a sign of chronic \nstress in a Thinking type but not in a Feeling type. \n\nAssessment of the Auxiliary Function Many problems \nencountered in counseling situations are related to failure to \ndevelop the auxiliary function. Isabel Myers' original and \nrevised type descriptions all discuss the consequences of \nfailure to develop the auxiliary function, and sensitivity to \nthese consequences should enter into the interpretive \ninterviews and the conduct of therapy. The developed \nauxiliary function provides balance between Perception and \nJudgment and enables expression of both Extraversion and \nIntroversion. Myers with Myers (1980/1995, p. 182) wrote, \n\"In type theory balance does not mean equality of two func- \ntions or of two attitudes; instead, it means superior skill \nin one, supplemented by a helpful but not competitive \nskill in the other. Some of the effects of failure to develop \nthe auxiliary function are described below: \n\nB Extraverts who habitually extravert both their dominant \nand auxiliary functions will place so much reliance on \nthe outer world that they will not be in touch with their \nown inner perception or judgment. For example, accord- \ning to the theory of type dynamics an ENFP extraverts \ndominant Intuition and introverts auxiliary Feeling. If he \nextraverts both dominant Intuition and auxiliary Feeling, \nhe may have little ability to judge himself and others from \nthe standpoint of his own inner values. He may therefore \nrely primarily on others judgments and be easily influ- \nenced by outside circumstances. The therapist can \nencourage clients who extravert both conscious tune- \ntions to question the accuracy and relevance of relying on \nother peoples perception or judgment and learn to attend \nto and value their own \"inner voice.\" Such clients may \nseek therapy during inidlife for issues related to habitual \nextraverting of the auxiliary function; they may report \nan emerging feeling that they lack inner substance and \nhave no comfortable sense of themselves. \n\nB Introverts who habitually introvert both their dominant \nand auxiliary functions will be so caught up in their inner \nworld that they will be ineffective in the outer world. \nThese Introverts may demonstrate the characteristics \n\nusually ascribed to shyness; their one-sided Introversion \nmay result in avoidance of the outer world rather than \npleasure in the solitude of their own company. In con- \ntrast, well-balanced Introverts relate to the outer world \nwith relative comfort by exercising their auxiliary \nExtraverted function. One-sided Introversion can be \nparticularly troublesome for young adults striving to \nsucceed in work and in intimate relationships. Indeed, \ndifficulties in these areas often bring such young people \nto seek help. \n\nTypes with Sensing or Intuition dominant (JJ and EP \ntypes) ean be so caught up in experiencing life that they \nfail to direct their activities and come to closure. For \nexample, according to theory an ISTJ has dominant \nIntroverted Sensing and auxiliary Extraverted Thinking. \nIf all or most of her energies are devoted to collecting \nand storing information, little or none is available to log- \nically organize the information and develop structures \nfor its use in the world. Without an Extraverted auxiliary \nfunction, an IJ might look like an exaggeration of a \npack rat, continually collecting either eonerete objects \n(for an ISJ) or more and more theories (in the case of an \nINJ). An ESFP should theoretically balance dominant \nextraverted Sensing with auxiliary introverted Feeling. If \nenergy is primarily devoted to stimulation of his five \nsenses, there will be little way for him to seleet and \nrepeat worthwhile experiences; he is likely to come \nacross as shallow, insineere, and unreliable. In contrast, a \nmore balanced ESFP will use a stable set of inner values \nto choose which sense experiences are most satisfying",

Similarly, a balanced ENTP or ENFP \nwill use the Introverted Judging function to choose \nwhich exciting projects are worth pursuing and complet- \ning, while a less balanced ENP is likely to flit [rom one \nexciting idea to another, accomplishing none of them. \nTypes with Thinking or Feeling dominant (IP and EJ \ntypes) can be so caught up with controlling their worlds \nthat they fail to collect data that would help them under- \nstand their experienees. Their judgments and decisions \nmay therefore appear categorical and ill founded because \nthey are in effect using only their dominant Judging func- \ntion without the balance that should be provided by gath- \nering and considering relevant information (Perception). \nFor example, an ENT] (dominant extraverted Thinking \nwith auxiliary introverted Intuition) should, according to \ntheory, be making judgments about relevant information \nacquired through Intuition. If little or no data are allowed \nin, his categorical and extreme judgments will likely \ncome aeross as overcontrolling and domineering, and he \nwill be seen as judgmental. Similarly, the dominant intro- \nverted Feeling of an ISFP, in the absence of auxiliary \nextraverted Sensing, may result in low self-esteem and \nhypersensitivity to criticism. The client draws negative, \nerroneous conclusions about her self-worth because ade- \nquate data are not available to her dominant Feeling \n\nJudgment. For further discussion of failure to develop the \nauxiliary function, see Quenk (1985b). \n\nAssessment of the Tertiary and Inferior Functions In \ntheory, individuals are least effective and most vulnerable in \nthe areas of their third and fourth functions, especially the \nfourth, or inferior, function. Counselors new to type theory \nmay take the position that if clients have dominant Feeling, \nthe most helpful counseling strategy is to help them develop \ntheir inferior Thinking. This is not the approach taken in \ndevelopmental counseling, which builds on strengths to get \nto weakness. The client is encouraged to use the dominant \nand auxiliary functions to strengthen the less secure and \nmore inexperienced tertiary and inferior functions. \n\nIsabel Myers (Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985; p. 64) described \nthis in giving the rationale for differential development of \ntype functions. She stated that \n\n[t]he kind of perception one prefers and the kind of judgment \none prefers determine, between them, the directions in which \none can develop most fully and effectively with the most satis- \n[action 10 oneself. . . . It is sometimes said that both kinds of \nperception and both kinds of judgment should be developed \nequally. The answer is that such a dead level of uniformity \nleaves one with no stable direction for ones life. Each of the \nfour functions has its own objectives, its own fulfillments. The \ngoals of the opposite functions are not compatible. Intuition \ndoes not want the same things as sensing. Feeling is not satis- \nfied by what satisfies thinking. One cannot direct ones life \neffectively toward a desired result until ones hest-trusted kind \nof perception and best-trusted kind of judgment are agreed as \nto what is to be desired. \n\nIndividuals are most willing to develop skills in using less- \npreferred functions when doing so is in the service of their \ndominant and auxiliary functions. This useful strategy for \ndeveloping the less-preferred functions helps achieve goals \nset by the dominant and auxiliary functions. For example, an \nENFP in theory would be caught up with new possibilities \n(dominant Intuition) for people (auxiliary Feeling). It is diffi- \ncult for an ENFP to deal with matters in a tough-minded \nfashion (tertiary Thinking) or with attention to practical \ndetails (inferior Sensing). If the ENFP is enthusiastic about a \nproject that captures his Intuition and Fecling, Sensing and \nThinking will be used in the service of Intuition and Feeling \nto accomplish the practical aspects of the project. Exercises \nol this nature are valuable for teaching full use of perception \nand judgment; they are also a way to help clients identify \nwhich functions are easier or more difficult for them. \n\nExperience and maturity can lead to natural develop- \nment of less-preferred functions. For example, an experi- \nenced INTP family practice physician may carefully collect \nfacts and details (tertiary Sensing) and develop a successful \n\"bedside manner\" (inlerior Feeling) in seeing her patients \nbecause doing so serves her dominant Thinking and auxil- \niary Intuitionwhich she relies on for arriving at a diagno- \nsis. Experience has also taught her that such an approach \nencourages patient compliance with treatment. \n\nUses of Type in Counseling and Psychotherapy 231 \n\nCounselors can help clients make conscious use of ter- \ntiary and inferior functions through practice, not through \nunderstanding alone. The counselor can first help clients \nidentify their less-preferred functions and become aware of",

Small tasks are especially important for practicing \nless-preferred functions, since initial failures can be inter- \nesting experiments, not blows to self-esteem. Practical exer- \ncises that encourage gaining access to, experiencing, and \ndeveloping each of the functions can be found in Myers and \nKirby (1994). \n\nEruptions of the Inferior Function During the course of \npsychotherapy clients are likely to report concern and \ndistress about episodes of unfamiliar and disturbing \nthoughts, feelings, and actions. Such reports often conform \nto eruptions of their unconscious inferior functions. \nUnconscious energy is most likely to emerge when the \nclients level of conscious control of dominant and auxiliary \nfunctions is lowered. This shift of energy from conscious \ndominant to unconscious inferior often occurs in response \nto stress, fatigue, illness, and consciousness-lowering drugs \nsuch as alcohol. In terms of type dynamics, it puts the \nindividual in the awkward and distressing position of trving \nto operate using the least experienced, most undeveloped, \nmost unconscious, and largely ineffectual parts of his or her \npersonality. When a therapist explains the role of the \ninferior function in normal type dynamics, and describes \nthe predictable form of each inferior function, clients often \nexperience a sense of relief. The predictability of their out- \nof-character behavior reassures them that they are not in \ndanger of totally losing control of themselves and are not \n\"crazy.\" The dynamics and descriptions of the eight inferior \nfunctions can be found in Quenk (1993, 1996). \n\nBecause severe stress often pushes people to seek ther- \napy, clients may not reveal their typical dominant and auxil- \niary strengths during initial sessions. They may come across \nas poorly developed, exaggerated versions of their opposite \ntype. Only when the severity of stress has diminished will \nthe therapist recognize the clients more typical type func- \ntioning. The presence of unusual stress should be a clue to \nthe practitioner that type may be distorted and that accurate \nassessment of type will be initially questionable, either \nthrough inquiry or through administration of the MBTI. \n\nThis section has provided examples of some of the practi- \ncal applications of type dynamics. For insights into other rel- \ncvant dynamic issues related to counseling and psychother- \napy, see Corlett and Millner (1993), Jones and Sherman \n(1997), Jung (1923/1971), McCaulley (1990b), Myers and \n\n232 The Uses of Type \n\nKirby (1994), Provost (1993), Quenk (1989), Quenk, A. T. \n(1985), and Quenk and Quenk (1982). \n\nCapitalizing on Knowledge of Whole Type \n\nCounselors and psychotherapists who incorporate a typo- \nlogical framework into their work can become sensitive to \nthe nuances that differentiate each of the 16 types. They can \nweave this level of typological awareness into a broad range \nof therapeutic issues and across a wide spectrum of clients. \nAs experience and knowledge grow, the existence of type \ndifferences serves as an implicit assumption that informs \nthe therapists awareness and appreciation of the individual- \nity of every client. The following comments are examples of \njust a few of the subtle qualities that emerge as distinctive \ntherapeutic issues for some of the 16 types. \n\nBW INF] clients often admit to the therapist their fear that \nthey are or could easily become \"crazy.\" Their fear is a \nfunction of their uncanny ability to read the underly- \ning emotions of the individuals and groups of people \nwith whom they interact long before anyone else is \naware that such emotions exist. \n\nBW ESFP clients acknowledge feeling not quite grown up \nin comparison with other people. This is understandable \nin light of their focus on sensual experience in the pres- \nent and their often fun-loving approach to life, which \ndoes not fit well with the notion of responsibility and \nattention to long-range goals. \n\nB IST] clients, particularly men, tend to agree with a thera- \npists suggestion that they express love for their children \nby providing financial security and ensuring that the \nchildren behave in an appropriate and responsible man- \nner. These clients can become quite emotional at the \ntherapists recognition that an ISTJs family may misin- \nterpret such an expression of love as a need to control \nand dominate the child. \n\nB ENTP clients may acknowledge with some discomfort \nthat they have an underlying fear that they lack substance \nand seriousness and that their contributions are not really \nvalued.

They analyzed extensive \nobserver ratings, self-ratings, and personality measures, such \nas the Adjective Check List and California Q-Sort, in relation to \nthe personality types of a variety of subjects who partici- \npated in intensive assessment sessions at the Institute for \nPersonality Assessment and Research (IPAR) at the Univer- \nsity of California, Berkeley. Two measures of personal ad- \njusunent, the Waltz-Gough Efficacy Index and the Marrot \nPsychological Soundness Index, were developed from avail- \nable data and examined in relation to whole types. Impor- \ntantly, neither the trained psychologists who observed and \nrated subjects nor the subjects themselves had any knowl- \nedge of psychological type. Therefore, the assessments of \npersonal adjustment were made from a general normative \nview that reflects professional and socictal values and \nexpectations. Observer ratings of gender appropriateness \nwere also subject to general notions of adjustment. \n\nThe efficacy measure was developed by Waltz and Gough \n(1984) using items from the Adjective Check List data pool. \nSubjects scores on efficacy were based on a difference mea- \nsure of pooled observer ratings on a set of indicative adjec- \ntives relative to contraindicative adjectives.

Table 10.2 \nshows the indicative and contraindicative items used to cre- \nate this index. One can infer thal some types, for example, \nESTJ or ESFJ, might be more likely to be seen as sound, \nwhile other types, for example INFP or INTP, could give the \nimpression of having a deficit of soundness. \n\nTable 10.3 provides the rank order of the 16 types on \nthese two measures of adjustment for males, and Table 10.4 \nprovides the same information for females. \n\nThe rank orderings shown in Tables 10.3 and 10.4 are \nexamples of the type and gender biases to which different \ntypes in our culture may be subject. Such cultural influ- \nences may contribute to or exacerbate the psychological \nand emotional difficulties that lead people to seek counsel- \ning and psychotherapy. Type and gender in combination \ncan have marked effects on how people are assessed by both \nprofessional and lay observers. The two highest means for \nsoundness for males are ESTJ and ESFJ; the lowest are \nINTP and INFP. For females, the highest soundness indexes \nare ENFJ and ESFJ, and the lowest are INTP and ESTP. Top \nmale scores on efficacy are obtained by ESFP and EST]; bot- \ntom scorers are INFJ and INFP. For females, top elficacy \nscores are obtained by ESFJ and ENF], and low scorers are \n\nESTP and ESFP (although sample sizes limit interpreta- \ntion). Being an ESJ rather than an IP is considered posi- \nlive for males; being an EF] rather than an ITP is consid- \nered \"positive\" for females. \n\nClient and Counselor Communication Styles \n\nThe counseling session offers a laboratory for Isabel Myers \nprescription for successful comnunication. She wrote that \nliln order to be successful, a communication needs to be \nlistened to without impatience and understood. without \nhostility\" (Myers with Myers, 1980/1995). \n\nClients best understand counseling interventions \ncouched in the their own type language. Sensing language \nis more concrete; Intuitive language is more abstract and \nsymbolic. Thinking language is more objective and analyti- \ncal; Feeling language is more personal. With practice and \nan attentive ear, counselors can use words that help the \nclient feel understood. When introducing a topic to a \ngroup, a reference to practical issues (Sensing), new possi- \nbilities (Intuition), long-range consequences (Thinking), \nand help for people (Feeling) will provide motivation for \neach of the functions. \n\nSensing types, particularly ISJ types, often describe \nevents with many circumstantial details. Intuitive coun- \nselors who immediately see what the client is leading up to \ncan be tempted to interrupt. Interruptions can be seen by \nthe client as a disconfirmation of the clients own style, a \nlack of understanding or respect. \n\nIntuitive type clients who often use abstract or symbolic \nterms can lead counselors to erroneously believe they \nunderstand the client. The assumption of understanding \nmay rest on the different meanings the client and coun- \nselor give to the terms being used. The counselor should \n\n234 .

Does knowledge of the psychologieal type of a client \nhelp in understanding, assessing, and treating such stress- \nrelated complaints? It is reasonable 10 expect that different \ntypes will define, experience, and react to stress in type- \nconsistent ways, may use different kinds of eoping strate- \ngies in dealing with life problems, and may find different \nenvironments more and less hospitable to their natural \ntypological characteristics. The review of researeh on \nhealth, stress, and coping provided by Shelton (1996) sup- \nports the differential experiences and responses of the I6 \ntypes and groupings of types in these important areas. Rele- \nvant results from this review are summarized in the \nresearch tables included in Chapter 4. \n\nThis section focuses specifically on research results \nobtained in studies of the 3,000 members of the national \nsample used to create MBTI Form M, and on recent research \nwith a few other samples and measures that used Form M. \nThe Appendix fully describes the samples used here. \n\nAmong other questions, participants in the national \nsample were asked whether they had ever had heart disease \nor hvpertension, what they found stressful in life, what \nwere their typical ways of coping with stress, and whether \nthev believed in a higher spiritual power. The several previ- \nous studies that looked at tvpe and heart disease, as sum- \nmarized by Shelton (1996), found that across studies, Intro- \nverts are more than one and one-half times as frequent in \ncoronary heart disease (CHD) groups than would be \nexpected relative to their proportion in Myers' high school \nsample.? (See 1985 Manual, pp. 50-51.) Dominant intro- \nverted Sensing types (ISTJ and ISFJ) appear two to three \ntimes more frequently as well. Sensing types in general were \nfound to be overrepresented in CHD studies, and 5] types in \nparticular were overrepresented. It is important to note that \nall of the studies previously reported used subjects who had \nbeen diagnosed with CHD and/or were in treatment pro-",

Research with the national sample \nused self-report data from a representative sample that was \nnot in any way selected for presence or absence of heart dis- \nease or hypertension.

Five of the top eight types prefer Introver- \nsion and three-quarters prefer Sensing. In addition, three- \nquarters of the top eight prefer Feeling over Thinking. In \ngeneral, the rankings in this table are in accord with data that \nreveal specific over- and underrepresentations of types and \ntwo-letter combinations of preferences that were found in \nearlier research. For example, ENFP, INT], and INFB who \nwere underrepresented in the CHD groups in earlier re- \nsearch, occupy the 13th, 14th, and 15th ranks in Table 10.5. \n\nThe information in Table 10.5 should alert counselors \nand therapists to the probability that some types are more \nprone to develop hypertension or heart disease than others. \nTo the extent that these conditions are a response to the \nstresses of living, finding ways to reduce stress and encour- \nage effective coping strategies seems an appropriate goal. \n\nWith regard to stress, sample members were asked to rate \ntheir typical level of stress about work, finances, children, \nintimate rclationship, school, health, caring for aging par- \nents, balancing home and work, and other. These areas \nwere rated as very high, high, moderate, low, very \nlow, or not applicable.\" Sample members overall rated all \nof the areas as moderately stressful, so the focus here is on \nthe more extreme responsesthose rating an area as \nextremely stressfal and those rating the area as quite low as a \nsource of stress. \n\nIndividual preference eflects were studied using log linear \ncomparisons of degree of reported stress for cach stress cate- \ngory. The following significant differences were found: Intro- \nverts (D) were significantly higher than Extraverts (E) on \nwork stress; types with a Sensing (S) preference were signifi- \ncantly higher than those preferring Intuition (N) on stress \n\n3 cc \n\nassociated with health, care for aging parents, and balancing \nwork and home; types who prefer Fecling (F) were signifi- \ncantly higher than those preferring Thinking (T) on the \nstress of finances, children, health, care for aging parents, \n\nand balancing home and work; types with a Perceiving pref- \nerence (P) were higher on stress associated with work; \ntypes who preferred Judging (J) reported higher stress on \nhealth and balancing work and home. Over and beyond \nthese single-preference results, data for whole types suggest \nsome interesting complexities that may be of interest to \ncounselors and psychotherapists. Table 10.6 shows the top- \nranked and bottom-ranked types in each stress category. \n\nAs can be seen, some areas appear to be particularly \nstressful for some types but provide minimal stress for oth- \ners. INFJ is top ranked in four stress categories, and ENTP \noccupies the bottom rank on three of the nine categories. As \nan indication of which types appear to be more and less vul- \nnerable to stress areas in general, Table 10.7 shows the num- \nber of times each type appears in either the top four \"more \nstressed group or the bottom four less stressed\" group. \n\nThis table suggests that Sensing Feeling types are partic- \nularly likely to rate a number of areas stressful and that this \nis true regardless of their preference for Extraversion or \n[ntroversion. Further, ESFPs are among the top ranked in \nhigh stress in seven areas, while their companion dominant \nextraverted Sensing type, ESTP, has no high-stress areas \namong the top four, and six areas where low stress is \nreported. Both INT] and INTP report high stress in some \nareas and low stress in others, and INTJs are perhaps the \nmost specific in their identification of high- and low-stress \nareas. The most clearly \"less-stressed\" types are ESTP, \nENTP, and ENT]; the most clearly stressed are ESFP, ISFJ, \nand INTP It is also of note that of the idealistic NF types, \nwho might be expected to be especially vulnerable to stress, \nonly INFJs report numerous stress areas.",

    "content": "Although some types appear be more stressed in general \nthan other types, what different types find particularly \nstressful and nonstressful probably involves a complex \ninteraction among personality, the nature of the stress, and \nunknown other factors. Counselors and psychotherapists \nwho have worked with clients of different types may find \nconfirmation for their observations in some of these \nresearch results. These possible type-by-stressor relation- \nships seem to suggest that the stresses of everyday life have \ndifferent effects on different types and that some types are \nmore naturally reactive to (or willing to acknowledge) \nstress than others. Counselors can take this into account \nwhen trying to assess the severity of their clients responses. \nFor example, an ENTP client who reports fecling very \nstressed in many areas may be of more concern to a thera- \npist than an [SF] client with the same complaints. \n\nResearch also supports the hypothesis that types cope \nwith stress differently and with greater or lesser facility.

A comparison of the percentages \nacross categories indicates the relative popularity of differ- \nent coping methods across types, with try to think of \noptions being frequently chosen by all types, and talk to \nprofessional and develop physical symptoms chosen rel- \natively infrequently. Perhaps this latter observation refleets \nthe general percentage of the U.S. population who seek the \nservices of mental health professionals and physicians for \nperceived stress-stimulated probleins. \n\nAlthough belief in a higher spiritual power is not neces- \nsarily related to differential coping with stress, therapists \nmay find it useful to understand their clients approach to \nspirituality in order to incorporate this into the therapeutic \nprocess. Table 10.9 shows, as might be expected, that the \ntypes answered the question Do you believe in a higher \nspiritual power?\" quite differently. The choices permitted \nwere \"yes,\" \"no,\" and \"not sure.\" \n\nEvery type predominantly answered yes to this ques- \ntion, as is apparent from the percentages for the no and \n\"not sure\" categories for the types listed. For example, 64.496 \nof the INTJ respondents answered yes, though their per- \ncentage of yes responses was lowest of all the types. As \nshown, the four top-ranked types saying no or not sure\" \nall have a preference for Thinking, and with the exception of \nISTPs they all prefer Intuition as well. All four top-ranked \ntypes saying yes prefer Feeling, and three-quarters prefer \nExtraversion and Judging as well. The clear TF difference in \nresponding to this question is in aceord with the critical \napproach of Thinking types and the harmony-seeking desire \nof Feeling types. Therapists might take these natural differ- \nences into account in expecting or encouraging different \ntypes to use spiritual resources as a way of coping or as a \nsource of satisfaction. \n\nJob burnout as a response to stress has been productively \nstudied using the MBTI instrument, particularly in Gardens \n1985 and 1988 research as reviewed in Shelton (1996).

Studies with larger, more heterogeneous \nsamples may produce more specific results by whole types \nand groupings of type. \n\nAnother study that used Form M explored the Positive and \nNegative Affectivity Scales (Watson, Clark, &amp; Tellegen, 1988) \nin relation to type. Positive affectivity reflects feelings of hap- \npiness, enthusiasm, interest, and inspiration and a general \nlack of anxiety. Negative affectivity reflects anxiety, fear, dis- \ntress, and distractedness. A sample of 279 college students at \na large Midwestern university were asked to rate their feel- \nings in these areas during the last three weeks on a five- \npoint scale varying from very slightly to extremely. Table \n10.11 shows the mean scores of the four highest and four \nlowest types on the two scales. \n\nAnalvsis of variance of positive and negative affectivity \ndata showed a significant F value (F = 2.0, p = .000) for posi- \ntive affectivity, most likely reflecting the tendency of the \nExtraverted types to score higher than Introverted types, with \nthe possible exception of INTJs. The same statistical proce- \ndure for negative affectivity yielded insignificant results. As \n\nsuggested in Table 10.11, types in the highest and lowest cat- \negories are somewhat inconsistent, and mean differences of \nhigh and low groups do not appear to be substantially difter- \nent. In general, then, these data suggest that although posi- \ntive affect is more likely to be acknowledged by types who \nprefer Extraversion, the reporting of negative affect does not \ndifferentiate between Extraverted and Introverted types. \n\nUsing Type with Different Age Groups \n\nRegardless of whether an assessment tool is used to elicit \ntype, awareness of the reality of type differences is helpful to \nclinicians who work with clients in all age groups. The \nbreadth of application lends credence to the notion that \ntypology serves as a basic template that influences and inter- \nacis with many other factors in an individuals personality. \nCounselors and psychotherapists are therefore likely to \nnote type influence with clients of any age and who present \na wide variety of psychological and emotional problems. \nThis section is designed to advise practitioners and alert \nthem to some of the relevant issues in using type with dif- \nferent age groups. \n\nIssues with Child Clients \n\nType is most effectively assessed in children using the Murphy- \nMeisgcier Type Indicator for Children (MMTIC), which dit- \nfers from the MBTI in content, construction, and scoring. \nFor information on type assessment in children, see the \nmanual for this instrument (Meisgeier &amp; Murphy, 1987). \nProfessionals in this area generally advise caution in speci- \nfying a type for young and preadolescent children, as there \nmay be wide variations in the developmental process for \nindividual children. Nevertheless, counselors and thera- \npists who treat young children often find that the hypothe- \nsized type of a child may be related to the childs presenting \nproblems. For example, some ESTP and ESFP children may \nbe referred for various behavioral disorders, hyperactivity, \nor attention deficit disorder when in fact the behaviors that \n\n240  TheUses of Type \n\nstimulated the referral may be well within what is expected \nfor young Extraverted Sensing types, whose natural style is \nvery active, interactive, experiential, and experimental. \nAwareness of the possible influence of type differences can \ntherefore aid mental health professionals in the diagnostic \nprocess. For additional information on the relevance of \ntype in assessing and counseling children, see Murphy \n(1992, 1997). \n\nIssues with Adolescent Clients \n\nRegardless of the presenting issues that bring adolescent \nclients to a mental health professional, administration and \ninterpretation of the MBTI can provide immense relief and \nalfirmation for young people who are questioning their \nacceptability as individuals and menibers of important peer \ngroups. For example, a 15-year-old INTP who is ambivalent \nabout fitting in with her peers can be assured of the rca- \nsonable and natural basis for her ambivalence; an ENFP \nwho has been persistently criticized for procrastinating can \nfeel validated by his type description and then encouraged \nto go against his grain\" by adopting some strategies for \nmeeting deadlines; an INFJ can be reassured that her \nuncanny knack for knowing the unspoken thoughts and \nfeelings of others is shared by other people of her type; an \nEST] can gain insight into why his fricnds sometimes are \nirritated by his attempts to be helpful in group situations. \nPsychological type develops over the lifespan. Young peo- \nple are expected to be less clear about their preferences than \nmature people, as is evident in the lower reliabilities found \nwhen the MBTI is administered to younger groups (see \nChapter 8). Some adolescents may have difficulty identily- \ning a best-fit type because of this as well as because their",

    "content": "expression of type may be influenced by pressures to fit in \nwith the group. Determining a preference for Extraversion \nor Introversion can be most affected by this. Counselors and \ntherapists who use the MBTI inventory with adolescents \nshould be prepared for questions and doubts from some \nclients. Other adolescenti clients may readily verify a type that \nfits them well. It is important to convey to unsure clients that \nthis is natural, normal, and predictable and that it is not nec- \nessary or important for the client to scttle on a type at this \nstage of life. The counselor can use the clients type informa- \ntion to validate, reassure, and help the adolescent cope with \nstresses and pressures and better prepare for the future. \n\nIssues with Middle-Aged and Older Clients \n\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, Jungs theory predicts differen- \ntial use and development of type in the second half of life, \nwith greater energy bcing devoted to exercising the tertiary \nand inferior functions. There is wide variation in ways of \nrecognizing and expressing less developed functions dur- \ning midlife and into old age. Many individuals mellow \ninto old age, gradually shifting energy and focus from the \ndominant and auxiliary functions by adding interest in the \n\ntertiary and inferior functions. For others, the shift may be \nmore sudden, extreme, and disruptive. These latter older \nclients are more likely to seek help than those for whom \nthe process is mild and gradual. One can interpret the \nbehavior of many clients who come to therapy with an \napparent midlife crisis as the midlife emergence of the \nthird and fourth functions. Clients in this situation may \nrcport loss of interest and meaning in what has heretofore \nbeen exciting and important, a feeling of being invaded by \nalien and uncontrollable thoughts and feelings, and a dis- \ntressing loss of a sense of self. In the most dramatic cases, the \nindividual may leave spouse and family to take up a new \npartner, or a successful career may become so unsatislying \nthat the person leaves it to do something entirely different. \nTherapists sensitive to the characteristics of the inferior func- \ntion can often interpret the clients experiences in these terms \nand explore the developmental nature and meaningfulness of \nthese often quite puzzling and distressing experiences. \nUnderstanding the meaning and importance of what is hap- \npening to them sometimes enables clients to proceed in their \ndevelopment without making major changes in their own \nand others lives. For information on the dynamies and \ndevelopment of midlife and older people, see Corlett and \nMillner (1993), Quenk (1993), and Millner (1998). \n\nUsing Type with Couples \n\nHappy and unhappy marriages are found in all type combi- \nnations, and type differences and similarities are likely to be \nonly one of several sources of difficulty in a relationship. \nRegardless of the nature of such other difficulties, a typologi- \ncal approach to couples counseling can enhanee the thera- \npeutic process and increase the likelihood of an effective \noutcome. \n\nFocusing on natural typc differences early in the coun- \nscling process can be the \"neutral ground\" that enhances \nrapport, reassures the couple that the therapist is not likely \nto take sides, and provides a nonjudgmental! language for \ndiscussing sourees of irritation and misunderstanding. \nWhen interpreting results of the MBTI to a couple, it is use- \nful to let partners guess their preferences as they are dis- \ncussed and to compare these with the answers given on the \nIndicator. Both partners can be asked to comment on the \naccuracy ol type descriptions in describing both themselves \nand their partner and to discuss type characteristics as they \nalfect their relationship. \n\nWhen couples take the type Indicator \"for each other\" \nthat is, when they answer the questions the way they think \nthe partner would (see the section on administration and \ninterpretation later in this chapter)the therapist can iden- \ntify probable issues in the couples difficulties.

For such a couple, a typological \nexplanation of the differences they already recognize in \neach other can be therapeutic. Rather than attributing dif- \nferences to the partner annoying habits, hang-ups, or \nincompetence, the couple can learn to appreciate the \nnature and reality of their differences as legitimate and \ninteresting. \n\nThe task of counseling is very different when the couple \nbelieve they are both the same or similar in type (therefore \nanswering for each other inaccurately), when in fact they \nare quite different. When a person believes the partner to be \na different type from what he or she actually is, the misper- \nceived partners communications and behavior arc likely to \nbe misunderstood. The misperceiving partner may have a \ndistorted notion of the others needs and motives. For \nexample, an ENTP husband answered the Indicator for his \nwife as if she were an ENFP, but she verified her type as \nESFJ. Her major complaint in the marriage was that she felt \ndiscounted, ignored, and misunderstood by her husband. \nIt became evident during counseling that he did not recog- \nnize her central desire for harmony and togetherness. \nInstead, he assumed that what she really wanted was more \nfreedom to pursue her many interests without interference \nfrom him. He was genuinely puzzled when she told him \nhow bad she felt. In another couple, the INFJ husband and \nhis ESFP wife both saw each other as ISTJs; they later recog- \nnized that both of their fathers were probably ISTJs. The \npartners thus projected an exaggerated and distorted IST] \n\npersonality on each other, each seeing the other as demand- \ning, critical, and controlling. These and similar kinds of dis- \ncrepancies in the ways couples answer the MBTI for each \nother can often reveal the nature of the couples expecta- \ntions of and projections onto each other. \n\nDifferences Related to Each \nof the Four Dichotomies \n\nCounseling issues vary considerably with the type mix of \nthe couple. Sharing the perspective on the mutual useful- \nness of opposite types, as shown in Table 10.12 and in \nIntroduction to Type (Myers, with Kirby &amp; Myers, 1998), \ncan be a focal point for the couple to gain insight into the \nvalidity of their diffcrences and the positive nature of each \nothers contribution to the relationship. In addition, the \nfollowing suggest issues and approaches to differences in \neach of the type dichotomies. \n\nE-i Differences Issues of sociability (Extraversion) and \nprivacy (Introversion) need to be resolved for couples who \ndiffer on this dichotomy. The Extravert needs to have \nsufficient external stimulation and the Introvert needs \nsufficient time alone. A first step is getting each partner to \nrecognize the legitimate but different energy needs of the \nother partner. Such recognition is difficult when either \npartner is Introverted and expends his or her finite \nExtraverted energy during the work day. Little Extraverted \nenergy may be left for talking and interacting with the \n\n242 The Uses of Type \n\npartner or for socializing with others in the evening. An \neffective recommendation is for the Introvert to have a \nperiod of time alone soon after coming home. The couples \nagreement to the legitimaey of such brief \"alone time ean \nprove restorative and enable the Introvert to be responsive \nand sociable. \n\nCouples who differ on Extraversion-Introversion may \nalso have a problem communicating, since the Extraverted \npartner is more likely to reach deeisions by talking them out \nand getting feedback, while the Introverted partner is more \nlikely to process issues internally, sharing only the final eon- \nclusion. This difference leaves the Extraverted partner feeling \nexcluded from an important source of satisfactionmutual \nsharing. The Introverted partner may experience the Extra- \nverted partners insistence on joint problem solving as intru- \nsive and controlling. Explaining their different approaches to \nprocessing and sharing information can encourage them to \nmodify their mutual misperception. \n\nS-N Differences When a couple differs on Sensing and \nIntuition, misunderstandings can occur because the two \npeople often look at the same event very differently. It is \nimportant that they define terms carefully. Intuitive type \npartners with rapid insights can make Sensing type partners \nfeel slow and mundane.

A careful \nexplanation of their very different processes of gathering \nand trusting information can help the couple understand \nand accept the reality of their differences. The counselor ean \nencourage them to verify their understanding of each other \nby asking elarifying questions and accepting the answers as \nvalid reflections of the partners state of mind. \n\nT-F Differences When a couple differs in Thinking and \nFeeling, decision-making issues can be a source of dilficulty, \nsince one partner will favor a logical, objective approach to \narrive at truth and the other will value a personal, subjective \napproach to arrive at harmony. Thinking types can become \nirritated when Feeling types appear to ignore the logie of a \nsituation and come to a conclusion that seems illogical; \nFeeling types often accuse Thinking type partners of being \ncold, unearing, and hypereritical. Such misperceptions \noceur regardless of gender, although gender stereotypes add \nan additional stressor when addressing Thinking-Feeling \ndifferences in relationships. \n\nDifferences on this dichotomy are subject to definitional \nmisunderstandings as well as gender stereotypes. Thinking \nis often confused with intellectual competence and lack of \nemotion; Feeling is confused with intellectual fuzziness and \nexcessive emotionality. Thinking is assumed to be the special \nprovince of men, Feeling of women. Thus when the male \nprelers Thinking and the female Feeling, there is conformity \nto what is expected. However, this conformity can encourage \n\nboth the couple and unaware therapists to assume that gen- \nder accounts for what are primarily ThinkingFeeling differ- \nences. Rescarch supporting clinical observation regarding \ntype and gender differences can be found in Otis and \nQuenk (1989) and Demarest (1997). When the male is the \nFeeling type and the female the Thinking type, confusion \nand misunderstandings arise because neither partner con- \nforms to expectations. There may be accusations that the \nwoman is unfeminine and the man lacks masculine traits. \nHelping couples distinguish between genuine gender influ- \nences and Thinking-Feeling differences is often a very \nfruitful therapeutic intervention. \n\nThinking types can improve relationships by voicing \nappreciation before giving criticism and by making critical \ncomments only when necessary, rather than as a natural, \nautomatic response to the partner and the world at large. \nFeeling types can improve relationships by stating their \nwishes clearly, so that the Thinking type does not have to \nguess about their needs and desires. Feeling types can also \navoid having hurt feelings by learning to differentiate \nbetween intended critical assessments and comments that \nsound like personal criticism but are merely impersonal \nobservations from the viewpoint of their Thinking type \npartner. Couples therapists can be especially helpful by \nusing their type knowledge to \"translate\" the Thinking lan- \nguage of one partner into the Feeling language of the other, \nand vice versa. Such type translations were first incorpo- \nrated into psychotherapy by Jung himself. As described by \none of his biographers, Barbara Hannah (1976), \"[A]fter he \nhad written Psychological Types and had considerably more \nexperience of people, Jung was able to speak the language \nof every type. Just as he took a lot of trouble to learn the \nlanguages of his patients (English, French, and so on), so \nhe learned to put things into the language of the psycholog- \nical type to whom he was talking\" (p. 132). \n\nJ-P Differences Issues of order, territory, and lifestyle are \ntypically associated with the Judging-Perceiving dichotomy. \nOrder in the surroundings is often more important to the \nJudging partner; spontaneity and freedom are more \nimportant to the Pereeiving partner. How much advance \nplanning is necessary or comfortable for each partner may \nalso be an issue. As a counseling technique, the practitioner \nmight have the couple discuss how thev have planned for \nvacations and what each believes to be the issues in vacation \nplanning. This exercise can be enlightening to couples. \nDisagreements are also likely to arise about how much data \nshould be collected before making important decisions and \ntaking action. The Perceiving type partner may wish to do \nan exhaustive search of all the available alternatives before \npurchasing a new piece ol furniture, while the Judging type \npartner may be ready to decide alter seeing only a few items. \nA counselor can encourage forbearanee of each other's \nstyles and suggest ways to compromise to achieve relative \ncomfort for both partners about the timing of decisions. \n\nUses of Type in Counseling and Psychotherapy 243 \n\nTable 10.13 Attraction Ratios (AR) for Men and Women Married to Opposite and Like Types \n\nARWhen AR When \nMarried to the Married to the",

Intimate relationships provide a fer- \ntile ground for projection of unconscious processes. For \nexample, an INFP-ENT] couple embody each others infe- \nrior functions. In the normal demands and stresses of every- \nday life, the INFP husband may easily perceive his ENT] \nwile as critical, judgmental, and disapproving, projecting his \nown inferior extraverted Thinking onto the wife, who is an \nappropriate host for this projection. Similarly, the ENT] \nwife can respond by feeling intensely hurt, unloved, and \nrejected, projecting her own inferior introverted Fecling \nonto her husband. Couples counselors who are sensitive to \nthese and similar dynamic interactions can help the two \npeople understand their own and each others often exagger- \nated reactions. Such awareness can promote mutual accep- \ntance and enhance the intimacy in the rclationship. \n\nCouples who share the same type can also face difficulties \nin relating to each other and to others. Because they share \nthe same blind spots, both may inadvertently neglect impor- \ntant aspects of daily living and avoid incorporating unfamil- \niar but important alternative perspectives into their lives. A \ntherapist working with such a couple can point out the \ninevitability of the missing points of view in their lives and \nhelp them come up with ways of broadening the scope of \ntheir activities in useful ways. Another way that like-type \ncouples sometimes handle mutually unappealing tasks is for \n\none partner to take on the responsibility for some of the dis- \nliked areas. The reluctantly responsible partner may become \nresentful and irritable, especially if such efforts go unrecog- \nnized or are criticized by the other person. A couples thera- \npist can reduce the strain this causes in the relationship by \nhelping the couple recognize and acknowledge their mutual \ndistastes. They may then be able to divide those tasks more \nequitably, or at the very least express appreciation to the per- \nson who voluntarily goes against her or his grain. \n\nResearch on Type and Couples \n\nCouples often ask how common it is to marry their own \ntype or an opposite type. The 1985 MBTI Manual com- \npared data from two samples of couplesMyers with \nMyers (1980/1995, p. 128) and a sample consisting of \ncombined data from the databank of the Center for Appli- \ncations of Psychological Type (CAPT). Those data as well \nas more recent research (Marioles, Strickert, Babcock, \nCampbell, &amp; Cortner, 1997; Marioles, Strickert, &amp; Hammer, \n1996; Sherman, 1981) indicate that people tend to marry \nsimilar rather than dissimilar types. For example, Marioles, \nStrickert, and Hammer (1996) calculated attraction ratios \nfor men and women married to opposite and like types, \nwhere higher ratios indicate greater attraction and lower \nratios less attraction. Table 10.13 shows the attraction ratios \ncalculated for each type within cach gender. The attraction \nratio is the percentage of people of one type who marry a \nperson of another type divided by the percentage of that \n\n244 The Uses of Type \n\ntype in the base population. Higher attraction ratios mean \nthat the pairing occurs more frequently than would be \nexpected relative to its occurrence in the base population. \nOnly in three notable instances (ESTJ men married to \nINFP women, ESTP men married to INF] women, and \nENTP men married to ISF] women) is there any evidence \nof opposite types being attracted to each other. Other pair- \nings reflect greater evidence of type similarity. \n\nMarioles et al. (1996) also looked at type and a measure \nof satisfaction based on self-assessment of the relationship \nas very dissatisfied and somewhat dissatisfied (com- \nbined) compared with somewhat satisfied and very satis- \nfied (combined). In examining rankings by the percentage \nof relationships in whieh both partners were satisfied, no \ntype-related pattern was found for women. However, the",

It was further observed \nthat INTP men had by far the lowest pereentage of relation- \nships in which both partners were satished (only 33%), \nalthough INTP men themselves reported being satisfied with \ntheir relationship. This result led to the development of an \nobliviousness indexthe difference between the percentage \nof one type who say they are satisfied and the pereentage of \nthe same type in the relationships in which both partners are \nsatisfied. The authors hypothesized that the greater the dif- \nference in the couples satisfaction levels, the more oblivi- \nous\" is the partner with the higher satisfaction rating. Table \n10.14 shows the obliviousness indexes for cach type sepa- \nrately by gender. It is interesting to note that INTP men \nhave the highest index of all the types, regardless of gender \n(3396). ENFJs are highest among female types (1396), \nthough at a much lower percentage than male INTPs. \n\nAnother source of data on marital satisfaction comes \nIrom the national sample. Subjects in this sample were \nasked to rate their satisfaction with their marriage or inti- \nmate relationship using the same four-point scale as that \nused in the Marioles ct al. (1996) study. The national sample \ndata were analyzed by type but not by gender. Partner satis- \nfaction was not assessed in the national sample study. The \ntwo sets of data, therefore, cannot be compared. In addition \nto rating satisfaction with marriage, subjects in this study \nwere also asked to rate their satisfaction with their friend- \nships and their relationships with family members. Figure \n10.1 shows the results for all 16 types in their ratings of the \nthree areas of relationship satisfaction. It is important to \nnote that types who are satisfied or dissatished in one rela- \ntionship area tend to rate the other areas in the same way as \nwell. Perhaps relationship satisfaction\" is a generalized \nphenomenon that reflects the possibility that different types \nuse different definitions of or criteria for satisfaction. The \nobservation that, in general, types who prefer Extraversion \nare more satisfied than types who prefer Introversion would \ntend to support such a conjecture. Introverts may have \ngreater discomfort with and/or idealized expectations of \nrelationships in comparison with Extraverts, whose comfort \nin and greater ease with others may be in operation. \n\nTable 10.14 The Obliviousness Index \n\nPercentage of Percentage of \n\nMen of This Type Women of This \nWho Are Satisfied, Type WhoAre \nType of Whereas the Satisfied, Whereas \n\nSatisfied Person Woman Is Not the Man Is Not \nIST} 16% Th \nISTE Q76 0% \nESTE 9% 0% \nEST] 12% 9% \nISFJ 14% 10% \nISFP 22% 4% \nESFP 21% 5% \nESF] 10% 8% \nINF} 31% 0% \nINFP [1% 0% \nENFP 776 | 276 \nENF} 10% 13% \nINTJ 0% 11% \nINTP 33% 0% \nENTP | 126 | 126 \nENT] 19% 0% \n\nSource.

Used with permission \n\nWith regard to satisfaction with marriage/initimate rela- \ntionship, Figure 10.1 shows INFJ, INEP, and INTP types to \nbe the most dissatisfied and ENFJ, ESFP, and ESFJ types to \nbe the most satisfied. INT] types seem particularly dissatis- \nfied with friendships and relatively more satisfied with their \nfamily relationships. \n\nEmpirical studies that assess the use of type by therapists \nin conducting couples therapy are not available. However, \nthe large-scale and multifaceted research of Marioles, \nHammer, and their colleagues provides relevant results on \nattraction, satisfaction, persistence of relationships, and \nassociated variables. For example, their research indicated \nthat the two male types who tended 1o marry their oppo- \nsites were ESTJs and IST]s, and that these two types had \nalso been married most often. Clinical observation and \nexperience seem to support this in that ISTJ-ENFP couples \n(regardless of gender mix) seem to seek therapy more often \nthan other opposite combinations. However, ESTJ-INFP \ncouples appear relatively infrequently for couples counsel- \ning. Perhaps this particular opposite type mix promotes the \nkind of stability and division of roles and responsibilities \nthat is satisfying for both partners. Another clinical obser- \nvation is that IST] and EST] male clients whose wives have \ninitiated a divorce scem to have greater difficulty than other \ntypes in adjusting to being single, tend to remarry relatively \nquickly, and often have several marriages in their history. \n\nUses of Type in Counseling and Psychotherapy  245 \n\n3.8 \n3.6 \n \n$4 \nJ We + \ni e. m \n34 ? \n? * \n \nE 4 \nE] * \" \n= 2 \n3.0 \n28 | | | \nIST] ESTP ISFJ ESFP INF} ENFP INTJ ENTP \nISTP ESTJ ISFP ESF} INFP ENF} INTP ENT) \nType",

These ongoing studies also use MBTI Form J \nand therefore provide information about the 27 subscales \nscored by that form. \n\nUsing Type with Families \n\nType concepts can be useful in family counseling. The type \ndistribution of the family provides a language for talking \nabout alliances, difficulties in communication, allocation of \nhousehold tasks, differences over child rearing, and chil- \ndrens career plans. \n\nWhen working with families, it is particularly relevant to \ndiscuss the value of type differences. Any relationship suffers \nif the oppositeness of preference is treated as an inferiority. \n\nThe parent-child relationship suffers severely if a parent \ntries to make a child into a carbon copy of him- or herself. It \nis hard on children to find that  parent wishes they were \nsomething they definitely are not. Children who are Feeling \ntypes may try to distort their type in the desired direction; \nThinking types may resist their parents expectations with \nhostility. Neither reaction repairs the damage done to the \nchilds self-confidence. \n\nThe Judging-Perceiving dichotomy can be important in \nchild-parent relationships. For example, a parent describing \na childs behavior in a Judging manner can be shown that his \nor her every description is full of judgments (This is \nwrong.\" He shouldn't have done that.\" I made a mis- \ntake.\"). Practice in the Perceiving attitude can lead to state- \nments such as, \"Why did it look like that to him?\" \"I won- \nder if he did it because . . . ?\" The essence of the Perceiving \nattitude is that a topic opens up new questions and creates \ncuriosity for learning more about a situation. Judgment \ncloses the issue; perception opens it up for new discoveries. \n\n246 The Uses of Type \n\nMany Judging tvpes benefit from learning to stay longer in \nthe Perceiving mode; many Perceiving types benefit from \nlearning to come 10 closure. \n\nIt can be helpful for the counselor to give parents a per- \nspective on how parenting dilfers based on the type of the \nchild. It is easier for an orderly, practical Sensing Judging \nparent to raise a Sensing Judging child who has a desire to \nconform to structure than it is for that parent to rcar an \nindependent Intuitive Perceiving child who finds structure \nand consistency anathema. Understanding type differences \ncan reduce guilt in the relationship and promote problem \nsolving on the part of both parent and child. \n\nFamily therapists report that understanding type often \nhelps all family members modify their perceptions about \nthe meaning and motives behind each others behaviors. \nThe therapist can suggest ways for family members to bet- \nter explain themselves and more accurately assess the \nmeaning of each others communications. Suggestions rele- \nvant to using type in families can be found in Meisgeier and \nMeisgeier (1989) and in Murphy (1992). Ginn (1995) \ndescribes the distinct ways in which each of the types func- \ntions as a member of a family; the way that type influences \ndifferent ways of mothcring is presented in work by Penley \nand Stephens (1994). \n\nUsing Type in Treatment \nfor Chemical Dependency \n\nIt is advisable that a respondent be drug-free for at least 30 \ndays prior to MBTI administration, or that the MBTI be \nadministered at least 30 days after admission to the treat- \nment program, as earlier administration is likely to yield \nunreliable results and may elicit a client's attempt at cop- \ning, albeit unsuccessfully. Chemical- and alcohol-impaired \nclients are also likely to have a high frequency of low pref- \nerence clarity indexes when the MBTI is administered \nduring active drug use. When entry into a treatment pro- \ngram is not voluntary and/or a client denies any abuse, \ninquiry should be made into the clients chemical use pat- \ntern during the preceding 30 days, to determine when the \nMBTI is best administered. \n\nExperienced counselors advise interpreting the MBTI \ninventory with caution, even after a 30-day drug-free period. \nAs compared with general clients, those with addiction histo- \nries may agree too readily with their reported type without \ncarefully assessing its best fit. Such clients can be encouraged \nto focus on the parts of their description that seem to fit well \nas a vehicle for helping the counselor in treatment planning. \nPreliminary analysis of data collected on 500 male and female \nclients in an alcohol and drug addiction trcatment program \nsupports the use of caution in administration and interpreta- \ntion. The MBTI was administered 30 days after admission and \n\nagain six months later to these clients. Approximately 80% of",

Many clients expressed relief at \ntheir newfound freedom to be themselves. However, they \nalso reported that their families and friends showed some \ndifficulty in accepting them in their newly emerged state \n(Shuck &amp; Manfrin, 1997). \n\nWhen attempting to determine best-fit type, therapists \nshould be sensitive to such factors as age of onset of drug \nuse. Arrested development of personality can be a conse- \nquence of early age of onset of addiction; doubts about type \nmay be present, and helping the client identify his or her \nnatural type may be a gradual and difficult process. Clients \nwith carly onset of addiction as well as those with codepen- \ndency issues may adopt the type of the therapist, thus \nadding to their difficulty in recognizing who they are. \nCounselors who incorporate their knowledge of type in \ntreating chemically dependent individuals attest that its \nvalue lies in helping them better understand their clients \npsychological makeup and enabling them to tailor interven- \ntions to the verified or hypothesized type of the client. Coun- \nselors also find it profitable to tailor their language to the \nclients strengths, as a way of encouraging collaboration in \nand cooperation with a treatment plan. In one treatment \nfacility where type was routinely collected for both clients \nand therapists, an attempt was made to match clients and \ntherapists in therapy groups. Chents whose types included \na preference for Thinking and/or Judging were placed in a \ngroup cofacilitated by an INT] and an ISF] therapist. Feel- \ning type clients were placed in a group co-led by an INFP \nand an ENFP, and a Sensing Perceiving therapist requested \nand was given a group made up of acting-out adolescents. \nAn unusually low dropout rate was found for all three \ngroups. Of particular note was that clients who were man- \ndated to be in treatment voluntarily remained in group \ntreatment longer than was requireda phenomenon that \noccurred rarcly if ever prior to client-therapist matching \n(Shuck &amp; Manrin, 1997). \n\nResearch with addictive populations shows some consis- \ntency in finding a preference for Introversion among those \nwho seek treatment for chemical dependency, though gen- \neralizing this result to addicted individuals who do not seek \ntreatment is not warranted. For a review of studies of type \nand chemical dependency, sec Quenk and Quenk (1996). \n\nSummary of Clinical Research \n\nThis section summarizes the rescarch presented in the 1985 \nMBTI Manual and bricfly comments on studies included in \nthe more recent MBTI Applications (see Quenk &amp; Quenk, \n1996), which covers research available since the manuals \npublication. Readers are referred to the latter publication for \n\nauthors, titles, and details of the study results summarized \nhere. The section is organized into major research topics. \n\nProviders and Users of Psychological Services \n\nType theory can illuminate many of the personality and \nbehavior differences among providers of psychological ser- \nvices, and it raises issues about the delivery of health care. \nAll 16 types are represented by providers of psychological \nscrvices, and all 16 types become clients, but the distribu- \ntions of both differ from the general population. In theory, \nhelping people through psychological methods requires \nmore Intuitive than Sensing skills, since Intuition is con- \ncerned with perception of patterns, recognition of inferred \nmeanings, and intangible relationships. In a study by New- \nman (1979), Intuitive types scored significantly higher than \nSensing types on ability to identify implied meanings. A \nstudy by DiTiberio (1977) found Intuitive types higher for \ncovert feeling messages. \n\nAny career that deals mainly with people tends to attract \nmore Feeling than Thinking types. The 16 studies in the \n1985 MBTI Manual that looked at characteristics of \nproviders of psychological services confirm this expecta- \ntion. A higher percentage of therapists/counselors who pre- \nferred Feeling over Thinking was found in all but 5 of the \n32 samples analyzed separately in the 16 studies. In the 27 \nstudies in which a Feeling preference predominated, the \npercentages preferring Feeling over Thinking ranged from \n52 to 84. The studies covered included samples of coun- \nselor trainees (Levell, 1965), secondary school counselors \n(Terrill, 1970), Veterans Administration therapists (Braun, \n1971), counseling supervisees (Beck, 1973), residence hall \nassistants (Schilling, 1972), doetoral students in the help- \ning professions (Frederick, 1975), counselors of runaway \nyouth (Elliott, 1975), crisis center staff (Galvin, 1976),",

Occupations that require practitioners to deal \nwith large numbers of people tended to have more Ex- \ntraverts, and there were relatively more Sensing types in the \noccupations in which counseling is accompanied by more \npaperwork. Given that the majority of the population \nprefers Sensing, the fact that most counselors prefer Intu- \nition creates a responsibility for counselors to learn meth- \nods for communicating with and treating Sensing type \nclients. \n\nDiffering styles of doing therapy were reported for Sens- \ning and Intuitive type therapists in the more recent studies \nreviewed in MBTI Applications (see Quenk &amp; Quenk, 1996). \nDifferences on the S-N dichotomy were revealed in the \nassessment of client symptoms and prognosis, the amount \n\nUses of Type m Counseling and Psychotherapy  247 \n\nand kind of information needed for accurate evaluation of \nclients, and the use of metaphor. Differences on other \ndichotomies also provide potentially useful information for \ntherapists in understanding their own styles of doing ther- \napy and insight into ways they can modify their style to bet- \nter accommodate clients ol different types. \n\nThe results of some of the recent studies that looked at \npsychotherapy outcome variables point to possibly com- \nplex interrelationships among client and therapist type \ncharacteristics and outcome measures such as satisfaction. \nTherapist-client type similarity appears to affect some kinds \nof outcomes positively and others in negative or more com- \nplicated, nonlinear ways. Some of the earlier results re- \nported by Mendelsohn (1966) seemed to anticipate such \nresults. Relatively small numbers of subjects, types of ther- \napy, different lengths of treatment and treatment settings, \nand other uncontrolled variables related to clients, thera- \npists, and contexts make comparisons and generalizations \n(rom the available studies difficult. However, such results \ncan be useful to practitioners in stimulating awareness of \nmore subtle factors that may be at work in their interactions \nwith clients. \n\nA recent study serves as a model of a carefully conceived, \nanalyzed, and interpreted research effort that capitalizes on \nan in-depth understanding of type dynamics. Otis and \nLouks (1997) investigated the hypothesis that psychologi- \ncal dysfunction is expressed differently for different types. \nThey studied a sample of Introverted male veterans using \nmeasures of Rebelliousness and Psychological Distress \ndeveloped through a factor analysis of the Wiggins Content \nScales of the MMPI. They found that INTP and ISTP types \nwere both more likely to score higher than expected on the \nRebelliousness measure as compared to a random sam- \npling on this dimension, and significantly more likely to be \ndiagnosed with combat-related post-traumatic stress disor- \nder as well as antisocial and avoidant personality \ndisorders. They were also more likely to have heen arrested \nfor a non-substance abuse crime and to have had trouble \naccommodating to the behavioral constraints imposed by \nthe inpatient treatment facility in which the research was \nconducted. ISFJs were more likely to score lower on Rebel- \nliousness,\" ISFPs had the highest score on Subjective Dis- \ntress, and ISEJs and INFJs were more likely to be given one \nof the dramatie diagnoses. INTJ was the only type to \nstand out with a diagnosis of major depression. Ihe \nrescarchers discuss these and other findings in the context \nof patient histories and as a function of the distinct dynamic \nqualities of the types. \n\nProfessional Orientation \n\nIn theory, Extraverts should preler to focus on environmental \nissues and to work with larger numbers of individuals and \ngroups. Introverts should prefer to focus on intrapsychic \ntherapy, to work with individuals, and to provide longer-term \ntreatment. Sensing types should prefer to use more applied \n\n248 The Uses of Type \n\nmethods; Intuitive types should prefer more dynamic \napproaches. Thinking types should prefer more analytical, \n\"tough-minded\" approaches, and Feeling types should be \ndrawn to approaches that involve understanding the client's \ngoals and values. Judging types should prefer more direc- \ntive and controlled kinds of treatment, while Perceiving \ntypes should favor methods that emphasize understanding \nthe client.

There ap- \npeared to be little if any effect attributable to Extraversion- \nIntroversion differences. \n\nTreatment Strategies \n\nThe 1985 MBTI Manual noted that very little work has \nbeen conducted on the appropriate treatment method for \nany given type. However, there is some evidence about the \ncounseling expectations of different types (p. 73). This \nsame statement appears to be true over IO years later. \n\nCarskadon (1979) asked college students what qualities \nthey valued in a counselor. Thinking types rated behavioral \ncharacteristics higher, and Feeling types rated humanistic \ncharacteristics higher. In a study of college students, Weir \n(1976) found that Feeling types who listened to an audio- \ntape of a counselor demonstrating high unconditional posi- \ntive regard were significantly more likely to prefer this \napproach than were other types. A study by Arain (1968) \nfound that among high school students secking counseling, \nThinking types preferred cognitive characteristics in \nprospective counselors, and Feeling types preferred affec- \ntive characteristics. \n\nColege undergraduates who volunteered for a small \ngroup \"self-understanding\" research project were 84% N (and \n5196 NF) types (McCary, 1970). In a group of medical stu- \ndents who were asked, How important is it for the facul- \nty to help you with your own personal development and \nself-understanding?,\" ST types reported low interest in self- \nunderstanding and NF types reported high interest in \nsclf-understanding. The ST types also reported that the fac- \nulty placed more emphasis on self-understanding than \n\nthey wanted. NF students in the same classes felt that the \nfaculty were neglecting this part of their education (Otis as \nreported in McCaulley, 1978, p. 188). \n\nThe studies by Mendelsohn and his colleagues using \nstudents who came to the university counseling center \n(1962-1967, cited at the beginning of this chapter) found \nthe following significant differences: (1) Compared with \ntheir peers, those who preferred Intuition, Thinking, and \nPerceiving were more likely to be clients of the center; (2) \nwhen the students had types similar to those of their coun- \nselors, they came for more sessions overall, but they also \nmissed more sessions during treatment; (3) students with \ntypes different from their counselors' almost always came for \nonly a few sessions; (4) students who were more like or more \nunlike their counselors later rated the counseling experience \nless favorably than did students of middle similarity \n\nAn unpublished study by Grant (1966) compared the \ntype distribution of 114 students with personal problems \ncoming to the counseling center at Auburn University to the \ndistribution of the student body. Types overrepresented in \nthe problem group\" were INFJ, INFP, INT], ISFP ENFP, \nand ENTP. Students underrepresented were ESTP, ISFJ, \nENF), ESFJ, ESFP, and EST]. INFPs came for more counsel- \ning sessions than did other students who sought counseling. \n\nIn these few studies, it appears that Intuitive types, who \nare more interested in psychological approaches to life, are \nalso more likely to seek psychological solutions to their \nproblems. The studies also suggest that there may be a \nmatch hetween the kinds of treatments preferred by clients \nof a particular type and the kind of treatment offered by \npractitioners of the same type. The more recent studies \nreviewed in MBTI Applications (sce Quenk &amp; Quenk, 1996) \nconfirm this finding. They reveal that just as people who \nprefer Intuition and Feeling disproportionately become \ncounselors and psychotherapists, so do clients seeking ther- \napy tend more often to be those same types. \n\nSupervision of Counseling \nand Psychotherapy Students \n\nA number of studies have appeared in the past 10 years that \nexamine type influences on student counselors and thera- \npists in relation to their supervisors as well as specific \nsupervision variables.

A \nstudy by Schacht, Howe, and Berman (1989) used scores on \nthe Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory as a measure of \nperception of the extent to which former training supervisors \nwere judged as facilitative by a sample of clinical and coun- \nseling doctoral psychologists who had recently completed \ntheir training. The investigators found that, although both \nThinking and Feeling types rated highly those supervisors \nwho were high in such areas as positive regard, empathy, \n\nunconditionality, and willingness to be known, Feeling \ntypes significantly and consistently rated their most helpful \nsupervisors as higher in regard and empathy than did \nThinking types. \n\nUseful information for counselors and therapists who \nsupervise trainees can be gleaned Irom studies that locus on \nthe different needs and expectations of student therapists. A \nstudy by Swanson and O'Saben (1993) found that Sensing \ntype supervisces expected tangible intervention by supervi- \nsors in times of crisis; Extraverted and/or Intuitive type \nsupervisees wanted direct supervision of their therapy ses- \nsions; gentle confrontation by the supervisor was desired by \nsupervisees with Introverted and/or Intuitive preferences; \nand Thinking and/or Perceiving type trainces wanted the \nsupervisor to be willing to engage in struggles and argu- \nments during supervision. \n\nAs mentioned by Quenk and Quenk (1996) in their \nreview of the research in this area, there is little if any \nattention paid to demonstrating whether knowledge of type \nis useful to supervisors and supervisees in learning to be \ntherapists or in thc conduct of psychotherapy. A recent \nresearch eflort, however, reports on a systematic effort to \ninclude training about type in a clinical program. Although \nthe program was a social work curriculum rather than clini- \ncal or counseling psychology, the model described could be \nreadily applicable to any effort that trains professionals to \ntreat client populations. Moorc, Dictz, and Jenkins (1997) \nreported on their attempt to incorporate awareness of type \nby faculty and students throughout the social work curricu- \nlum. The MBTI was incorporated into a number of courses \nwith the goal of increasing student self-awareness and ap- \npreciation of personality diversity as preparation for their \nfuture work with clients. This program extended over an \neight-year period. One group ol 44 senior social work stu- \ndents were asked to rate the potential utility of the MBTI in \nsocial work practice. There was general agreement on its \nusefulness in helping relationships with clients and co- \nworkers, awareness of personal strengths and limitations, \nincreasing sclf-awareness, understanding clients and co- \nworkers, and understanding bchavioral differences. \n\nThe MBTI was one of the instruments used in a counsel- \ning project that involved 50 midlife women who described \nthemselves as being in personal and career transition and \nparticipated in an eight-week individual and group counsel- \ning project (Schadt, 1997). A control group of women on a \nwaiting list for the program were compared on their results \non the MBTI as well as on the Bem Sex Role Inventory, the \nStrong Interest Inventory, and other scales designed to mea- \nsure wcll-being, self-efficacy, and self-esteem.

What factors should 1 consider in the timing of \nadministration? \nFactors such as presenting complaint, level of stress \nbeing experienced, anticipated client. interest and \nreceptivity, and reading and comprehension level, \namong other variables, should be considered in decid- \ning when to administer the MBII. Some therapists find \nit helpful to introduce type early in the process; others \nprefer to wait until they have a sense of the clients",

With some clients, giv- \ning the Indicator may not be appropriate or helpful \nat any stage of the counseling process. Clients with \nvery serious psychological disturbances may not be \nable or willing to respond candidly to the Indicator \nquestions. For example, somconc diagnosed with \nobsessive-compulsive disorder may have great diffi- \nculty making the choices required on the MBTI, result- \ning in both increased emotional distress and invalid \nresults. In spite of such caveats, however, a typc-awarc \npractitioner can use her or his sensitivity to type issues \nto help many such clients for whom the usual route of \nself-reporting on the MBTI may not be an option. \n\n2. What special approaches are appropriate for cou- \nples and families? \nWhen using the Indicator with couples and families, \nadministration carly in thc counseling process, even \nas homework after an initial session, can be useful \nand advisable, provided there is sufficient confidence \nthat Indicator results will not become just another \nway lor the couple or other family members to attack \nand disparage each other. When there are signs that \nthe MBTI is likely to be used only for destructive pur- \nposes, administration at any time is ill-advised. \n\n50 \n\nThe Uses of Type \n\nMany couples therapists have clients fill out the \nIndicator twice, once for themselves and a second \ntime the wav they believe the partner would answer. \nCouple members should be discouraged from eom- \nparing their responses while answering or belore an \ninterpretation session. If Form J or K is being used, it \nis advisable that Form M be used for the second, \"the \nway your partner would answer,\" administration. The \ndetailed information provided by the longer form is \nnot useful when the issue is the partners pereeptions \nof each others whole type. It is also advisable that the \nrequest to fill out the MBTI occur with both people \npresent, rather than at the individual sessions a thera- \npist may schedule in order to obtain individual back- \nground information. \n\n. Which form should I use? \n\nThe Step I standard Form M, or the earlier Form G, \ncan be used for individuals or eouples. Form K or \nForm J can also be helpful for both individual clients \nand couples; the individualized information these \nforms produce may aid both client and therapist in \nthe treatment proeess. For information about admin- \nistration and interpretation of these forms, see Saun- \nders (1987, 1989), Kummerow and Quenk (1992), \nQuenk and Kummerow (1996), and Mitchell with \nQuenk and Kummerow (1997). \n\nWhen treating families, the Murphy-Meisgeier Type \nIndicator for Children (MMTIC), briefly discussed in \nChapter 5, provides type information for children \nwho range in age from about 7 to 12. However, eon- \nsideration should be given to administering Form M \nor Form G to children who are 12 or older. \n\n. Where should the MBTI be administered? \n\nDepending on a variety of situational factors, some \ncounselors prefer to have clients fill out the Indicator \nwithin the counseling setting, while others give \nclients the question booklet and answer sheet to \nreturn either by mail or at the next seheduled session. \nFilling out the MBII *on site\" provides a common \nsetting and ensures return of the materials; having \nclients respond at home on their own time may \nencourage more spontaneous responses but also runs \nthe risk of extraneous influences and delay or failure \nto return materials. \n\n. Are there any special eautions I should be aware of? \n\n[n introducing the Indicator to individuals who have \ncome because of psychological difficulties, special \nattention should be given to possible concerns that it \nmay reveal psychopathology and/or that the client's \nresponses will reveal unconscious or other informa- \ntion of a negative nature. It is useful to explain that \nthe purpose of having type information is to enable \nbetter understanding of the clients natural and com- \nfortable way of operating and the ways the client may \nbe similar to and different from others. Knowledge of \n\ntype can also help both client and therapist better \nunderstand what is difficult and stressful for the \nclient, how he or she typically reaets 10 stress, and \nwhich coping strategies are likely to be most natural \nand effective for the individual. \n\nThe Indicator should not be administered to clients \nin an acute state, including those suffering from \nextreme depression or anxiety, in an ongoing life eri- \nsis, or experiencing any type of extreme emotion that \nis induced by aleohol or drug use. Administration \nshould be delayed until the counselor is confident that \nthe elient can respond as his or her typical self. \n\nQuestions About Interpreting \nthe MBTI and Verifying Type \n\nOn rare occasions, a client who has taken the MBTI inven- \ntory may be uninterested in knowing the results or the ther-",

    "content": "apist may feel that MBTI information is unlikely to be \nappropriate or helpful. In general, however, clients are \neager to have their results interpreted and interested in the \nimplications of their personality type for counseling and \npsychotherapy. \n\n1. What is the first step in interpreting the MBTI to \nelients? \nWhen type theory is used in counseling, the first step is \nto discover the clients true or best-fit preferences. The \ntheory behind the MBTI assumes that preferences are \ninborn and ean become distorted and confused by fam- \nily and other environmental pressures. Therefore, each \nstage of interpreting the MBTI results is essentially a \ntesting of the reported or hypothesized type against the \nrespondents experiences of his or her behavior. Refer \nto Chapter 6 for ways respondents can use the MBTI to \nindicate their inherent preferences. \n\nPositive insights can come from an awareness of \ntype distributions in the general population (see the \n\"Uses\" chapters in Part V) and of how the client may \nbe different from family and peer groups. The Intu- \nitive type who discovers that everyone else in his or \nher family of origin prefers Sensing gains a new per- \nspective about having always felt like an outsider. An \nExtraverted Intuitive type in a career attractive to \nIntroverted Sensing types can realize why work is \nfatiguing and unsatisfying (see career choice informa- \ntion in Chapter 12). \n\nClients who have correctly reported their prefer- \nences will usually show a sense of release when read- \ning their type descriptions. Such clients will naturally \nanticipate many of the consequences of their type and \nwill readily discuss the negative aspects of their type \nin a nondelensive way. They see the negative aspeets \nas simply the opposite side of their strengths. \n\nIsabel Myers believed that environmental pres- \nsures were important in determining the likelihood \n\nP \n\nof optimum type development. Causes of distortion \nof type are described in Chapter 6 and in Gifts Differ- \ning (Myers with Myers, 1980/1995, pp. 189-192). \nBoth Jung (1921/1971, p. 548) and Myers with Myers \n(1980/1995, p. 189) wrote that when external influ- \nences cause distortion of type, emotional difficulties \nwill follow. Practitioners are therefore advised to exer- \ncise caution and carefully check with their clients and \nwith their own observations of their clients for evi- \ndence of tvpe distortion. This is particularly impor- \ntant in counseling because a goal of treatment is to \nidentify and strengthen the inherent preferences, not \ncontinue and reinforce the distortion. \n\n. How do 1 help my clients determine their best-fit \n\npreferences? \n\nlf the client has doubts about the accuracy of the \nreported preference, be alert to his or her tone when \ndiscussing activities. Activities associated with nat- \nural preferences are usually described with pleasure \nor with an offhanded manner, taking them for \ngranted. When clients engage in these activities, they \nfeel motivated and energetic. Activities associated \nwith less-preferred functions are often described in \nterms of effort, struggle, and discomfort. Engaging in \nsuch activities is tring and can be depressing. \n\nUsually, the clients natural preferences are recog- \nnized early in the counseling process, often in the first \ninterpretive session. In some cases, one or more pref- \nerences remain in question at the end of the session. \nTherapist and client can agree to proceed with what is \nknown about the clear preferences while investigat- \ning further those that are not clear. For example, if \nIntuition is clear but there is doubt about whether \nThinking or Feeling is preferred, discussion can \nfocus on the implications of preferring Intuition. \nBetween sessions, the client can observe his or her \nexperience during decision making, noting which \noptions occur first and which carry the most weight, \nand how decisions that turned out to be good or bad \nwere made. This exercise is most useful when the \ndecisions scem relatively minor, such as where to go \nfor dinner or how to schedule a day. \n\nDepending on the purpose of counseling or psy- \nchotherapy and how long it is expected to continue, \nthe process of discovering and verifying best-fit type \ncan occur over an extended period of time. Exploring \nthe clients type often becomes an ongoing and nat- \nural part of the therapeutic process, with depth of \ninsight and understanding increasing over time. Clar- \nity about a clients type may occur quite late in the \nprocess, and in some cases, some measure of doubt \nmay persist. \n\nUses of Type in Counseling and Psychotherapy 251 \n\n3. How can type dynamics be used as an interpretation \naid? \nFor some clients, doubt about best-fit type involves \nlack of clarity between Extraversion and Introversion \nand/or Judging and Perceiving. Because both of these \npairs of opposite attitudes are necessary for determin- \ning type dynamics (see Chapter 3), doubt about one",

Practitioners \nwho are sensitive to type dynamics can listen for or \ninquire about dynamic differences and use this infor- \nmation to help clients determine their type. For \nexample, if the doubt is between ENFP, INFJ, INFP. \nor ENF] because the client is unclear about both E-I \nand J-P, the therapist can look for client characteristics \nthat are associated with cither dominant extraverted \nIntuition (ENFP), dominant introverted Intuition \n(NF, dominant introverted Feeling (INFP), or dom- \ninant extraverted Feeling (ENEJ). \n\nKnowledge of typical expressions of the least devel- \noped inferior function can also aid interpretation and \nidentification of best-fit type. If a client clearly experi- \nences the inferior function of one type rather than an \nalternative type, the likelihood is that the opposite ol \nthe identified inferior function is the best-fit dominant \nfunction. For example, if the doubt is between ESF] \n(dominant extraverted Feeling) and EST] (dominant \nextraverted Thinking) and the client reports that \nunder extreme stress he characteristically shows the \nsigns of inferior introverted Thinking (ESFJ) rather \nthan inferior introverted Feeling (ESTJ), serious con- \nsideration should be given to EST] as the best hypothe- \nsis of the clients type. Further exploration of the \nhypothesis during therapy is likely to provide addi- \ntional evidence for or against this hypothesis. \n\nConclusion \n\nThis chapter was designed to serve as a practical guide to \nusing the MBTI in a wide variety of settings and with a \nbroad range of clients. The goal was to acquaint readers \nwith a fairly complete picture of the relevance of type to a \nbroad range of areas. Of necessity, the coverage of some top- \nics is brief, but it is intended as suggestive. Readers are \nencouraged to consult the relevant resources recommended \nas a way to increase their depth of knowledge. However, the \nmost practical and fruitful way to benefit from type knowl- \nedge is through using type with clients, making observa- \ntions and informal hypotheses, and in general using a type \nlens\" as an aid to understanding the complexity and indi- \nviduality of clients seeking help. \n\n\"i ve = \n\nV- w- \n= 4 \n\n- e \nTN \n\na C \n\n, \n\nLI \n\ns * \n\n- g \n\n. 9 \n\ni i , \nnad: &gt; h, sw tg \na D og  4 \nc 5:74 A O \nFP $7 uM!

While schools \nand colleges have tended to measure aptitude and accom- \nplishment through the assessment of intelligence, Myers saw \nthings differently. She wrote, Within limits, type develop- \nment can substitute for intelligence, because average intelli- \ngence, fully utilized through fine type development, will give \nresults far above expectation. However, a serious deficit of \ntype development, especially a deficit of judgment, consti- \ntutes a disability for which no amount of intelligence can \ncompensate\" (Myers with Myers, 1980/1995, p. 177). \n\nThis chapter sheds light on the intersection between \ntype preferences and many traditional benchmarks of suc- \ncess in educational settings, including intelligence (at least \nas measured by IQ). Education appears to be the applica- \ntion area with the greatest current volume of MBTI \nresearch, perhaps because Myers earliest investigations \ninvolved students in school settings. Hence this chapter is \nstructured to provide research data at various levels of edu- \ncation, followed in each case by a discussion of implications \ntor the classroom. \n\n259 \n\n254 The Uses of Type \n\nBuilding upon the comprehensive review of the litera- \nture over the past decade found in MBTI Applications \n(Hammer, 1996b), this chapter also includes an updated \ndiscussion of some of the early research in education pre- \nsented in the 1985 MBTI Manual (Myers &amp; McCaulley, \n1985). Because most of the research to date is on separate \ndichotomies of the MBTI, a considerable portion of this \nchapter deals with the four pairs of opposite preferences. \nStudies of the 16 types in education are highlighted for set- \ntings where data are available. Occasionally studies are also \ncited that refer to the Murphy-Meisgcier Type Indicator for \nChildren (MMTIC); the MMTIC manual (Meisgeicr &amp; \nMurphy, 1987) should be consulted regarding its use. \n\nThe chapter begins with what we know about the 16 \ntypes in education. Because type theory is dynamic, this \nsection includes suggestions for responding to the subtle \ninteraction of MBTI dichotomies within the whole person, \nnot simply the addition of four preferences to one another. \nFor educators, it may be especially instructive to examine \npatterns for the different types across the life span and thus \nto acknowledge that for children, adolescents, and adults \nol the same type, the expression of their preferences must \nbe understood in the context of their type development. \n\nThe next section summarizes the research on character- \nistics of learners, dealing especially with learning styles, \ncognitive styles, brain patterns, and information process- \ning, with attention to the four MBT} dichotomies one \nat a time. The characteristics of teachers and patterns of \nteacher-learner interactions are presented next, including \nboth the benefits and limitations of matching learners with \ntheir teachers, supervisors, or settings by type categories. \n\nA section on academic aptitude and performance pro- \nvides an update of the discussion of early MBTI research in \nthis area, including comparisons with standardized test \ndata. Research findings in mathematics, reading, writing, \nand foreign language learning highlight the multiple pro- \ncesses employed hy different types to produce successful \nperlorinance. The section pertaining to elementary and sec- \nondary education suggests how educators can take type \ninto account in dealing with learning disabilities, behavior \ndisorders, and gifted learners. lt also addresses school cli- \nmate issues as related to the interaction of different types of \nadministrators, teachers, or counselors with students, espe- \ncially those at risk. College, university, and professional \neducation settings have spawned considerable MBTI re- \nsearch over the decades, and the next section shows how \nstudents in higher education can best work to their poten- \ntial. It is followed by a section on type and cultural differ- \nences in education. \n\nThe conclusion ollers specific suggestions on how to \napply Jungs type theory and the MBTI in educational set- \ntings. This section describes how to decide whether or not \nto administer a type indicator, which form of the MBTI is \nbest suited to the age level and educational purposes of the \ngroup, ways to maximize the likelihood that individuals \n\nwill respond to the Indicator according to their \"true type,\" \nand ethical issues regarding uses of the MBTI in educa- \ntional contexts. One purpose ol this section is to give focus \nto the increasing enthusiasm for the MBTI as an affirming \ninstrument. Another is to provide appropriate cautions on \nhow to avoid stereotyping or reducing respondents to cari- \ncatures. There are already too many unfortunate labels in \neducation. \n\nWorking with the 16 Types \nin Education \n\nThe MBTI was designed to indicate not only ones separate \npreferences on each of four dichotomies but ones whole",

To work \nwith individuals as a teacher, counselor, principal, or in \nother professional roles necessarily requires dealing with a \nwhole person. Thus this section considers the results of \nstudies in which patterns have been observed for the 16 \ntypes. \n\nChapters 3 and 4 are an essential resource for under- \nstanding how a persons MBTI profile involves more than a \nsimple addition of four preferences. From a strict linear \npoint of view an EST] type and an ESF} type would appear \nto have much in common, sharing as they do three of the \nfour preferences. However, the single letter of difference in \nthis case involves the dominant process: Extraverted \nThinking versus Extraverted Feeling. Such differences, as \nwill be shown, can have profound implications. \n\nEducators, who are involved in helping to nurture the \npersonal as well as the academic growth of students, can \nuse the theory of good type development to assist in these \nendeavors. As Chapter 4 suggests, working with an ESF] \nstudent in elementary school requires a different balance \nbetween challenge and support than does working with an \nESF} college student or fellow teacher. \n\nSummary of Research on the l6 Types \nin Education Using Form G of the MBTI \n\nTable 11.1 shows the results from Form G research during \nthe past decade, which produced findings pertaining to \none or more of the 16 types. The studies cover a wide \nrange of activities across various levels of education. The \nresults will be discussed by pairs of types sharing the same \ndominant function in the same attitude. \n\nISTJ and ISFJ (Dominant Introverted Sensing) ISTJ and \nISFJ types share in common a preference for quietly \n\ngathering the facts of the situation and carefully storing \nthose facts for later use. For these reasons they are often \n\nconsidered the most reliable of the types. This hard- \nworking orientation to life is represented by the appearance \nof ISTJs among the top four types in overall undergraduate \ngrades (Schurr &amp; Ruble, 1986) and by ISFJ students being \nrated by psychologists as among those least likely to have \ntrouble in school (Roberds-Baxter &amp; Baxter, 1994). Their \nsteadv-as-vou-go orientation to tasks is also reflected in a \npreference by ISFJ teachers for the basal approach to \nreading instruction (Lehto, 1990) and in the fact thai IST] \nis one of the two most frequent types among industrial \ntechnology teachers (Lawrence, 1993). While the concept \nof creativity is often stereotyped as characteristic of those \npreferring Intuition, Jacobson (1993) found IST]s to \npossess adaptive creativity, as measured by the Kirton \nAdaptation and Innovation Inventory. The difference between \nIST] and ISF} types is indicated by their different outwardly \nfocused auxiliary processes (Thinking for the former, \nFeeling for the latter). Given these patterns it is not sur- \nprising that ISFJs emerged as the second most frequent type \namong education majors in college (Grindler &amp; Stratton, \n1990) and that they also were rated high by faculty on \nbehavioral skills for dealing with dental patients (Dunning, \nLange, &amp; Adams, 1990). \n\nINF] and INT] (Dominant Introverted Intuition) The \nmost quietly imaginative of the types, INFJs and INTJs have \nconsistently appeared near the top in most investigations of \nacademic achievement. Kalsbeck (1987) found them having \nthe highest first semester grades in college, and Woodruff \nand Clarke (1993) reported them to be the two types with \nthe highest overall college grades. INFJs have been found \namong the highest persisters in college (Rigley, 1993; \nWaymire, 1995) and among the top four types in over- \nall grades (Schurr &amp; Ruble, 1986). INTJs had the high- \nest grades among persisters in another study (Anchors, \nRobbins, &amp; Gershman, 1989) and were among the highest \npersisters at church-related colleges (Waymire, 1995). At \none womens liberal arts college INTJs werc among the \nmodal types of resident assistants (Brush, 1989). When \njunior high school students (ages 12-14) were asked to \nwrite about their personal future and to indicate the \nprojected date of their story, INTJs identified the highest \nmean number of years projected beyond the present \n(Harrison &amp; Lawrence, 1985); the results reflect the \ndescription of Intuition as going beyond the immediate to \nimagine possibilities. A natural affinity for the academic \nworld would seem to be indicated in the study by Elliott and \nSapp (1988), which found INT]s to be Participant learners \non the Grasha-Rceichmann Student Learning Styles \nQuestionnaire; these learners are described as wanting to \n\"learn course content and like to go to class (p. 47). \n\nESTP and ESFP (Dominant Extraverted Sensing) From \nJungs theory, these types are the least likely to be patient",

Extraverted Sensing draws the \nindividual into the fascinating world of tangible reality, to be \nheard (with the volume up), touched, smelled, held, and \nseen up close. They naturally look to the outer world to set \nthe tone for what to do next, as long as the world around \nthem stimulates their senses. Elliott and Sapp (1988) thus \nfound that ESTP college students preferred collaborative \nlearning (liking to work with others) and that ESFPs were \ndependent learners with little intellectual curiosity who \nlook to others for guidelines. (p. +7). Holsworth (1985) \nfound both ESTPs and ESFPs to be field dependent on the \nGroup Embedded Figures Test (trusting stimuli presented \ndirectly to them, while field independents tend to \nperceive hidden patterns). Perhaps because these types rely \non the concrete world around them, unfavorable conditions \nmay sometimes lead them more than any other to do poorly \nacademically, whereas favorable settings allow them to do \nwell. Woodruff and Clarke (1993) found them the two \ntypes with the lowest overall grades in college. Anchors and \nDana (1989) discovered that they are overrepresented \namong college students referred for substance abuse \ntraining. On the other hand, they were among the highest in \nanother study of college retention (Anchors et al., 1989), \nand Rigley (1993) found ESFPs among those most likely to \npersist to graduation. \n\nENFP and ENTP (Dominant Extraverted Intuition) \n\nThese types have been described as the most noticeably \nenthusiastic regarding new possibilities. With dominant \nIntuition directed outwardly, they love to challenge existing \nideas with fresh and original options and do not like to stick \nto routine. They therefore present an interesting paradox, \nsince the initiative behind their dominant extraverted \nIntuition appears to breed success in some arenas and \ntrouble in others. ENFPs were significantly overrepresented \namong academically talented (labeled as gifted) elementary \nstudents (Mills, Moore, &amp; Parker, 1996) but were also rated \nby psychologists as among the three types most likely to \nhave trouble in school (Roberds-Baxter &amp; Baxter, 1994). \nENFPs were found to be creative in innovative ways rather \nthan adaptive ways (Jacobson, 1993). ENTP junior high \nstudents (ages 12-14) projected themselves farther into the \nfuture than any type except INTJ when asked to write about \ntheir personal futurc (Harrison &amp; Lawrence, 1985). \nHowever, ENTPs were also found 1o be highly represented \nboth among high school students in an off-campus program \nfor at-risk individuals (Hart, 1991) and among alcohol \npolicy violators at one undergraduate college (Barrineau, \n1997). They were also overrepresented among those \nreferred for substance abuse training at another university \n(Anchors &amp; Dana, 1989) and were among the lowest group \nfor retention in college (Anchors et al., 1989). ENFPs were \nthe third most frequent type among education majors \n(Grindler &amp; Stratton, 1990) and as teachers were found to \n\n256 \n\nThe Uses of Type \n\nTable 11.1 Research on the l6 Types in Education Since 1985 Using Form G \n\nIST] ISFJ \n\nLe Second most frequent type \n\nAdaptively creative learners \namong education majors! 4 \n\nOne of top two types among \nindustrial/technical teachers?!

INFPs have been \nfound by research to have a general advantage in foreign \nlanguage learning (Ehrman &amp; Oxlord, 1990) but also to be \nmost likely of the types among college students to have had \nsuicidal thoughts (Komisin, 1992). Another study of \ncollege students found INFPs overrepresented among \nalcohol policy violators (Barrineau, 1997). ISFP junior \nhigh students (ages 12-14) projected themselves the fewest \nnumber of vears into the future among the 16 types when \nasked to write about their personal future (Harrison &amp; \nLawrence, 1985); this reflects the orientation of their \ndominant Feeling toward present and past loyalties and the \nvalue of their auxiliary Sensing for what they can directly \nwitness in the moment. Type theory predicts that ISFPs will \nbe those most dependent on the encouragement of the \nworld around them and the least independently confident \nof their own abilities. This might help to explain their \nbeing among the least persistent in college in one study \n(Provost, 1985) and among the highest persisters in an- \nother (Rigley, 1993). \n\nEST] and ENT} (Dominant Extraverted Thinking) These \ntvpes like to control all that they ean. They are likely to \nproject personal confidence, are forthright, and naturally \ntake command in social or leadership situations. It is \ntherefore not surprising that research continues to confirm \nESTJs as most frequent among school administrators \n(Hoffman, 1986) and that ESTJs and ENTJs were the two \ntypes most frequent among the top 100 executive \neducators (Lueder, 1986). Their take-charge approach to \nthe tangible world leads ESTJs to be the most frequent of \nthe types among industrial and technical teachers \n(Lawrence, 1993) as well as among vocational teachers \n(Barrett, 1989). ESTJs were also least likely among college \nstudents to have suicidal thoughts (Komisin, 1992). Both \nESTJs and ENTJs were among the four types with the \nhighest overall undergraduate grades (Schurr &amp; Ruble, \n1986), and both were among the highest for retention in \neollege (Provost, 1985). ENTJs also had the highest grades \namong persisters in another study (Anchors et al., 1989). \nAt one college ENTJs were overrepresented among \nstudents referred for substance abuse training (Anchors &amp; \nDana, 1989). But at a womens liberal arts college they were \namong the two types (with INTJ) most frequent among \nresident assistants (RAs; Brush, 1989). ESTJs were also \noverrepresented among RAs in another study (Anchors &amp; \nHay, 1990). ENTJs were clearly the most frequent type \namong one years national finalists for the CASE college \nprofessor of the year (Provost et al., 1987). \n\nESF] and ENF] (Dominant Extraverted Feeling) These are \nthe most friendly and supportive of the types. Their mission \nin life is to make things easier for others, and they are \nnatural catalysts for group cohesion. ESFJs are thus the \nmost frequent type among education majors in college \n\n(Grindler &amp; Stratton, 1990). They were also found the most \nfrequent type among high school officers in a health \noccupations association (Walters, Wilmoth, &amp; Pitts, 1988). \nENFJs were rated by psychologists as one of the two types \n(with ISFJ) least likely to have trouble in school (Roberds- \nBaxter &amp; Baxter, 1994). They were also significantly \noverrepresented among resident assistants at one university \n(Anchors &amp; Hay, 1990) and were the most frequent in a 10- \nyear review of patterns among RAs at another (Hardy-Jones \n&amp; Watson, 1990). With Feeling as a dominant process, \nthese types rely on encouragement and support to do well. \nThus, similar to the pattern for ISFPs, we find mixed results \nin college persistence for ESFJs and ENTJs.

A \nfull discussion of this sample and validation studies of \nForm M may be found in Chapter 7 and the Appendix. \n\nTable 11.2 shows responses of the 16 types to these \nquestions: How do you spend your leisure time?\"; How \nmany hours a day do you watch television?\"; \"How impor- \ntant are each of the following in your life?\" The options \nreported here pertain to school-related activities that tend \nto be either curricular (e.g., reading, writing, appreciating \nart) or extracurricular (c.g., playing sports, watching TV, \nplaying with computers or video games). The table indi- \ncates those instances in which the percentage of a type \nendorsing the option was either significantly overrepre- \nsented (I &gt; 1.0) or underrepresented (1 &lt; 1.0) compared \nwith the percentage of that type in the sample overall. \nBecause these preliminary studies include instances in \nwhich the number of subjects endorsing an option was rela- \ntively small, only cases in which the level of statistical sig- \nnificance was either p &lt; .001 or p &lt; .01 are reported. \n\nMost notable are differences related to a preference for \nSensing or Intuition, especially when dominant. ISTJ and \nISFJ types stand out largely by their underrepresentation as \nreporters of almost any kind of leisure pursuit or activity of \nstated importance in their life. Each indicated only one \nsuch activity as favored, along with three (for ISTJ) and six \n(for ISFJ) as significantly underreported. The reverse find- \ning was true for Extraverted Intuitive types (ENTP, ENFP). \nEach endorsed six activities for either leisure or importance \nin their life, but in comparison they were underrepresented \nfor either one (for ENTP) or two (for ENFP). Consistent \nwith type theory, these results reflect the relative value for \nmixing leisure and play with learning for Extraverted Intu- \nitive types, and the contrasting concern for hard work and \n\n259 \n\nUses of Type in Education \n\nTable 11.2 Research on Reports of Leisure Time Preferences Pertaining to Education \nfor the 16 Types Using Form M \n\nIST) \n\n* Watching sporting events: \nf= 121 \n\n Listening to music: | = 0.83* \n Writing: | = 0.52* \n Appreciating art: | = 0.49* \n\nISTP \n\n* Playing with computers or \nvideo games: | = 1.39 \n\n Listening to music: | = 0.78* \n Writing: | = 0.39 \n\nESTP \n+ Playing sports: ! = 1.79* \n\nEST) \n+ Playing sports: / = 1.57* \n\n+ Achievement/accomplishment \nvery important: | = |.35* \n\n+ Watching sporting events: \nl= 1.20 \n\n Listening to music: | = 0.85 \n\nISFJ \n* WatchingTV 3 hrs or more \nper day: | = 1.12 \n Education/learning very \nimportant: | = 0.84 \n Achievement/accomplishment \nvery important: | = 0.80* \n\n Playing with computers or \nvideo games: | = 0.74* \n\n Watching sport events: | = 0.69% \n\n Appreciating art: | = 0.58* \n Playing sports: | = 0.47* \n\nISFP \n\n+ Watching TV 3 or more hrs \nper day: ! = 1.19* \n\n+ Watching TV for leisure: | = 1.12 \n\n Reading: } = 0.80% \n\n Achievement/accomplishment \nvery important: | = 0.74* \n\n Education/learning very \nimportant: | = 0.67* \n\n Working out/exercising: | = 0.66* \n Writing: | = 0.52 \n\n Appreciating art: | = 0.50* \n\n Taking classes: | = 0.49 \n\nESFP \n\n+ Watching TV 3 hrs or more \nper day: | = 1.21* \n Reading: | = 0.83* \n\n Working out/exercising: \n= 0.74 \n\nESF) \n Writing: | = 0.62 \n\nINF] \n+ Writing: | = 2.64* \n+ Appreciating art: | = 1.87 \n\n Watching sporting events: \n| 2 0.45 \n\nINFP \n+ Writing: | = 2.19* \n+ Appreciating art: } = 2.13* \n+ Reading: | = 1.22* \n+ Listening to music: ! = 1.20 \n\n Achievement/accomplishment \nvery important: | = 0.79 \n\nENFP \n* Writing: | 2 2.03* \n+ Appreciating art: |= |.97* \n\n+ Playing a musical instrument: \n[21.62* \n\n+ Listening to music: | = |.22* \n\n+ Education/learning very \nimportant: / = 1.20 \n\n+ Reading: /= 1.11 \n Watching TV for leisure: | = 0.89 \n\n Watching TV 3 hrs or more \nper day: | = 0.83 \n\nENF] \n+ Appreciating art: | = 2.01* \n+ Writing: |= 1.89 \n+ Education/learning very \nimportant: | = 1.54* \n+ Listening to music: I= 1.26 \n+ Reading: / = 1.24 \n\n Watching TV 3 hrs or more \nper day: | = 0.66* \n\nINT) \n+ Taking classes: | = 2.66* \n+ Appreciating art: | = 1.78 \n\n* Playing with computers or \nvideo games: / = 1.62 \n\n* Working out/exercising: \nf= 1.57 \n\n Watching TV 3 hrs or more \nper day: | = 0.58* \n\nINTP \n+ Appreciating art: | = 2.16* \n+ Writing: | = 2.00* \n\n+ Taking classes, going to school: \nl= 1.96 \n\n* Playing with computers or \nvideo games: | = |.67* \n\nENTP \n+ Taking classes: I= 1.87 \n+ Writing: | = 1.74 \n+ Appreciating art: | = 1.64 \n+ Playing sports: |= 1.56",

Three Intuitive types (ENFP \nENF], ENTP) significantly listed education and learning as \nvery important, while two Sensing types (ISFJ, ISFP) did not. \nThose endorsing writing as a leisure activity included over- \nrepresentations of all four NF types plus ENTP and INTP, \nand undcrrepresentations of IST], ISTP, and ESFJ. Appreciat- \ning art was favorably listed for six Intuitive and no Sensing \ntypes; on the other hand, three Sensing but no Intuitive types \nwere significantly underrepresented on this item. Only Intu- \nitive types favored reading, listening to music, or playing a \nmusical instrument as leisure activities. Only Sensing types \n(ISTJ and ESTJ) were overrepresented in watching sporting \nevents. Only SF types (ISEJ, ISFP, ESFP) reported watching \nthree or more hours of television per day, while only Intu- \nitive types (INTJ, ENTP ENFP. ENFJ) were significantly \nunderrepresented in this activity. \n\nThinking-Feeling differences accounted for several \ninteresting patterns. Only Thinking types with Extraversion \n(ESTJ, ENTP) significantly listed achievement and accom- \nplishment as very important, and only Feeling types with \nIntroversion (ISF], ISFP. INFP) did not. Playing computer \ngames drew INTP, ISTP, INTJ, and ENTP types; ISF] types \nwere underrepresented. Playing sports attracted. EST], \nESTP, and ENTP types, with ISFJ again underrepresented. \nWorking out/exercising was endorsed only by ENTJs and \nINTJs; it was shunned by ISFPs and ESFPs. It appears that \nthe interest in competition found in many computer games \nand sports provides the challenge needed by Thinking \ntypes, and even the individual challenge of working out or \nexercising seems to appeal to them as well. For sports, the \nexternal activity required also appears to attract Extraverts. \n\nThough these results came from responses to single \nitems on a questionnaire, the patterns confirm what type \ntheory predicts. Educators can learn much from the pre- \nferred leisure activities of the 16 types, especially as they \nhighlight traditional characteristics of curricular versus \nextracurricular activities in school settings. \n\nImplications for the Classroom \n\n3 \n\n\"Every type has its good and bad examples,\" wrote Myers \n(with Myers, 1980/1995, p. 173). As shown in this section, \nan understanding of dominant processes and the 16 types \ncan help educators nurture the potential strengths and lessen \nthe likelihood of problems among students. It appears, for \nexample, that in different ways cach type may be both open \nto the encouragement of the academic environment and \nsometimes also susceptible to the absence of such support. \n\nDominant Feeling types (ESFJ, ENFJ, ISFE INFP), \naccording to type theory, work at their best when they care \npersonally about the activity, and conversely they can feel \nunappreciated or doubt they have much to offer if they lack \nsupport. We thus see ISFPs among the highest in persis- \ntence in one college and among the lowest in another. At \nstill another college ESFJs were among the highest in reten- \ntion and their partner ENFJs among the lowest; nationwide, \nhowever, both types are in high percentages among educa- \ntion majors. INFPs excel in foreign language learning but as \ncollege students report suicidal thoughts more than other \ntypes. To deal with students like these, educators can con- \nsult type theory to personalize the environment so that \ndominant Feeling types can especially feel welcomed, regu- \nlarly encouraged, and challenged in areas in which they \nhave natural strengths. \n\nDominant Thinking types (ESTJ, ENTJ, ISTP, INTP), \naccording to type theory, are least likely to be influenced \nby the ups and downs of their surrounding environment",

This \ntough-mindedness serves them well when they take \ncharge of their environment as student and professional \nleaders in schools (true especially for ESTJs and ENTJs) or \nwhen they engage in careful analysis as in engineering \n(true especially for ISTPs and INTPs). Problems appear, \nhowever, when they do not care enough about the human \nexpectations of their instructors or peers. Thus referrals \nfor substance abuse include disproportionate numbers of \nENTJs and INTPs, and school psychologists tend to rate \nISTPs and INTPs as having adjustment problems. Again, \ntype theory can help educators provide the kinds of chal- \nlenges best suited to dominant Thinking types, whether \ninvolving work with computers, leadership, or competi- \ntive sports. \n\nDominant Intuitive types (ENTP, ENFP, INTJ, INFJ) \nseem to have the greatest advantage in education, especially \nhigher education. Their attention to conceptual matters, \ntheory, and broad patterns in complex material suits them \nwell. Thus Introverted Intuitive types (INTJ, INFJ) consis- \ntently appear among college students with high grades and \nthe greatest rates of persistence to graduation, and ENFPs \nare most frequent among academically talented children. \nWhere problems occur, they tend to appear most among \nExtraverted Intuitive types (ENTP ENFP), who sometimes \nare rated by psychologists among those most likely to have \ntrouble in school and who appear among college students \nreferred for alcohol or substance abuse violations. It \nappears that the need for originality can lead toward cre- \native productivity in some school settings and to trouble- \nmaking in others. Again, Jungs theory can help educators \nto adjust to the needs of each type. \n\nDominant Sensing types (ESTP, ESFP, ISTJ, ISFJ) vary \ndistinctly in their response to academic life. Furthermore, \nthe remaining four Sensing types, for whom the preference \nis auxiliary rather than dominant (ESTJ, ESFJ, ISTP, ISEP), \n\nsimilarly differ from one another in education. Those who \nprefer to use Introverted Sensing, whether dominant (ISTJ, \nISFJ) or auxiliary EST] ESFJ), prefer to record internally \nthe facts of the situation for future reference. This more \ncarcful orientation to Sensing appears to lead to high grades \nfor ISTjs and ESTJs, school leadership roles for EST]s as \nstudents or as professionals, and high frequencies of ISFJs \nand ESFJs among education majors. \n\nOn the other hand, those who prefer to use Extraverted \nSensing, whether dominant (ESTP, ESFP) or auxiliary \n(ISTP, ISFP), tend to experience the tangible world more \ndirectly, freely, and without structure. Lacking the more \norganized internal orientation to data of SJ types, they thus \nare more affected by the ability of the teachers and peers \naround them to assist with the tasks of learning. Schools \nand colleges appear less interested in gifts of spontaneity in \nthe experience of the real world. Myers (1962) early \nresearch found that SP types were most prone to drop out of \nschool. The findings reviewed in this section were more \nmixed. ISFPs were least persistent toward college gradua- \ntion in one study and most persistent in another. ESTPs and \nESFPs had the lowest overall college grades in one study \nbut were among the types most likely to graduate in other \nstudies. ISTPs were rated by school psychologists among \nthose most likely to have trouble in elementary or sec- \nondary school and were highly represented in at-risk high \nschool groups, but they reported during interviews by \nProvost (1985) that they do better in college when not dis- \ntracted by too many extracurricular activities. \n\nThe general lesson from both type theory and the \nresearch cited above appears to be that different types need \ndifferent kinds of support and challenge. A careful under- \nstanding of the dominant and auxiliary processes of each \ntype can also suggest dilferent responses to different types \nwhen they struggle with school or college contexts. An \nESFP facing disciplinary action, for example, is more likely \nto respond to friendly limit-setting along with active \nengagement in campus life, while an ISTP in similar trouble \nneeds room to work in isolation without too many social \ndemands. \n\n\"The strengths of each type materialize only when the \ntype development is adequate,\" according to Myers (with \nMyers, 1980/1995, p. 173). This lesson appears to apply \nnot just to students but to their teachers as well. For \nexample, the study of outstanding college teachers by \nProvost et al. (1987) reported the general teaching styles \nof these faculty as well as lessons they had learned over \nthe years about their natural pitfalls. The quotations indi- \ncate a confirmation not only of their type preferences hut \nof the theory of type development as well. Students and \nteachers alike can thus benefit from working first from \ntheir natural preferred styles, which then frees up energy",

The results, summarized in Table \n11.3, show how Jungs theory, which underlies the MBTI, \ncan be of powerful use in the classroom. Comprehensive \nreviews of these studies were conducted by Lawrence \n(1984) and DiTiberio (1996). What follows is a description \nof fascinating patterns that have emerged comparing cach \nMBTI dichotomy with aspects of learning styles, cognitive \nstyles, brain patterns, and information processing. \n\nThe Extraversion-Introversion Dichotomy \n\nA remarkable series of studies (Wilson &amp; Languis, 1989, \n1990) on brain electrical activity found for both adults and \nadolescents that Extraverts have lower internal arousal than \nIntroverts under all conditions established by the experi- \nment: eyes closed, low-level perceptual tasks, and then \nhigher-level cognitive tasks (see brain map on p. 190). These \npatterns help us understand the results of other research that \nshows, consistent with what Jungian theory predicts, that \nExtraverted students have been found to prefer approaches to \nlearning that arc collaborative and that they often depend on \nthe external world for suggestions on how to proceed (Elliott \n&amp; Sapp, 1988). A number of studies have also found them to \nlean toward learning styles that involve active experimenta- \ntion or concrete experience and sometimes both (Gordon, \nCoscarelli, &amp; Sears, 1986; Hinkle, 1986; Luh, 1991; Penn, \n1992). Atman (1993) discovered that Extraverts had a higher \nsense of goal-directedness and willfulness (described as cona- \ntion) than Introverts, both as adults and in junior high school \nsettings (ages 12-14). In contrast, Introverted students prefer \nreflective observation (Hinkle, 1986) and lecture formats \n(Fourqurean, Meisgeier, &amp; Swank, 1990). \n\nThe implications of these findings can be useful for educa- \ntors. Extraverts work best in action and may be described as \nstimulus hungry, perhaps due to physiological characteristics \nof the brain. The hustle-and-bustle that sometimes interrupts \nthe concentration of Introverts may be the needed prompt for \nExtraverts to engage their minds in learning. Introverts \nappear to do their best thinking in anticipation rather than on \nthe spot; it now seems clear that this is because their minds \nare so naturally abuzz with activity that they need to shut out \nexternal distractions in order to prepare their ideas. They can \nand will give an answer to a teacher who demands one imme- \ndiately but have better second thoughts once they have quiet \nfor concentration. Conversely, Extraverts can and will quictly \nfocus their attention when required, but they will be more \ninclined to do so if periods of quiet concentration are inter- \nspersed with regular doses of active engagement (preterably \nboth spoken and physical) throughout the learning process. \n\n262 The Uses of Type \n\nTable 11.3 Characteristics of Learners by Psychological Type \n\nExtraverts Introverts Sensing Types Intuitive Types \n\nConcrete experiential learning \nstyle? \n\nReflective observational learning \nstyle 15.23 \n\nAbstract conceptual learning \nstyle?? \n\nConcrete experiential learning \nstyle 4. 15.22.24 \nVisual learners? \n\nVisual learners?

As examples, Sensing types have been found to like \nsequential learning (Drummond &amp; Stoddard, 1992) and in \ngeneral favor both collaborative and dependent learning \nstyles (Elliott &amp; Sapp, 1988). Their approach to creativity \ntends to be adaptive, while Intuitive tvpes are innovative, \non the Kirton Adaption and Innovation Inventory ( Jacobson, \n1993). Sensing types approach learning through fact reten- \ntion, methodical study, and serialist learning (Beyler &amp; \nSchmeck, 1992). Sensing was the clearest preference among \nboth students and teachers of vocational edueation in three \nstudies (Barrett, 1989; Johnson, Zimmerman, &amp; Brooker, \n1994; Vollbrecht, 1991). In the 1985 MBTI Manual, Myers \n&amp; McCaulley reported data showing Sensing types as valu- \ning concrete experience on Kolbs Learning Style Inventory, \nwhile Intuitive types instead valued abstract conceptualiza- \ntion. Several studies have found them to favor the left hemi- \nsphere on the Human Information Processing Survey (Beyler \n&amp; Schmeck, 1992; Hockersmith, 1986; Taggart, Kroeck, &amp; \nEscoffier, 1991), in contrast to Intuitive tvpes, who in the \nsame studies favored the right. A recent review of the litera- \nture on brain functioning and type (Power &amp; Lundsten, \n1997) confirmed these patterns and called attention not \nonly to hemispheric preference but also to cerebral (favor- \ning Intuition) versus limbie (favoring Sensing) thinking \nprocesses as measured by the Herrmann Brain Dominance \nInstrument. \n\nIntuitive types are described as holistic learners (Beyler \n&amp; Schmeck, 1992), field independent (Holsworth, 1985), \nand having thin boundaries (Ehrman, 1993). They have \nbeen found to score higher than Sensing types on measures \nof postconventional ethical decision making (Catoe, 1992; \nFaucett, Morgan, Poling, &amp; Johnson, 1995), reflective judg- \nment (Bowen, 1990), and conation or goal orientation in \nadults (Atman, 1993). McCaulley and Natter (1974) dis- \ncovered that a preference for independent study among \nhigh school students was found among Intuitive types, a \npattern confirmed in a later study of self-directed learning \n( Johnson, Sample, &amp; Jones, 1988). They were also found \nto identify with the philosophy of alternative high schools \n(Steele, 1986). Academic self-esteem (Schaefer, 1994) and \nacademic comfort (Apostal &amp; Trontvent, 1989) have been \nfound to be higher among Intuitive types; however, Ham- \nmer and Kummerow (1996) suggested that these kinds of \nhndings reflect academia as it is currently constructed. \nThey called attention to the equally academic value that",

A back-to-the-basics ap- \nproach may reflect the cry of students, teachers, or parents \nwho feel inundated by innovations for their own sake. If \n\n263 \n\nUses of Type in Education \n\nmany of these voices come from Sensing types, it is fully \nunderstandable that their natural strengths of methodical, \nsequential attention to the facts may have been unappreci- \nated. In contrast, the voices of Intuitive types may have been \nthe ones a generation ago calling for independence among \nlearners and innovative approaches to problem solving. \n\nJungs theory of opposites can help to relieve the polar- \nization, since he wrote so insightfully (1923) about the \nsubtle balance needed between the praetical and the imag- \ninative and about the dangers inherent in pitting one too \nconsistently against its opposite. Type theory suggests that \nSensing types can and will produce original ideas but usu- \nally after first consulting what they know for sure about a \ntopic. They carefully (and more slowly than do Intuitive \nstudents) follow each step in sequenee. Thus grounded in \nthe real data, they can then produce the kind of big picture \nthat does not lack in detail (as so many of the initial \ndreams of Intuitive types do). Conversely, Intuitive types \ncan best learn to accumulate necessary facts if their imagi- \nnations are first allowed to roam free, without impediment \nor excessive rules. Once inspired, Intuitive types then \nhave psychological energy left to fill in the missing pieces. \n\nToo often a Sensing student with an Intuitive teacher, \nor vice versa, may be asked to produce evidence of learn- \ning in a manner that feels absolutely backward to them. \nThe research cited in Table 11.3 suggests that Sensing \ntypes move first from the particular to the general, and \nIntuitive types the other way around. Both approaches are \nuseful. Unfortunately neither will emerge in healthy form \nif authority figures polarize this dichotomy by insisting \nthat one and only one way will work. \n\nThe ThinkingFeeling Dichotomy \n\nThinking types have been found in research to reflect a sys- \ntematic approach to learning (Gordon et al., 1986). They \nhave also been described as field independent (trusting per- \nceptions of hidden patterns among distracting stimuli), \nwhile Feeling types are field dependent (tending instead to \nfollow their perception of the immediate stimuli themselves) \n(Holsworth, 1985). Beyler and Schmeck (1992) found \nThinking types to prefer a faet orientation, methodical \nstudy, and serialist learning, and Feeling types to preler \nholistic learning. They also found Thinking types to be ori- \nented to the left hemisphere and Feeling types to the right. \nShiflett (1989) produced similar findings for Thinking \ntypes in terms of brain patterns. Approaches to moral deci- \nsion making have been found to link Thinking types with \nconcerns for self-justice and Feeling types with care and \nself-care (Liddell, Halpin, &amp; Halpin, 1992). Thinking types \nwere also found to score highly on goal orientation as \nadults, but Feeling types scored higher in a study of junior \nhigh students (ages 12-14) (Atman, 1993). \n\nAn understanding of the ThinkingFeeling dichotomy \ncan shed light on the debate about learner characteristics by \n\n64 The Uses of Type \n\ngender since it is the only dichotomy of the MBTI to pro- \nduce consistently different percentages among males and \nfemales. While there may certainly be gender differences \nworthy of note in education, what passes for gender may \nbetter be conceptualized as a type difference, as was sug- \ngested by Oxford, Nyikos, and Ehrman (1988) in their \nstudv of foreign language learners. In a study of separate \nversus connected knowers, inspired by the writings of \nresearchers in womens studies, Feeling was preferred \n(along with Extraversion) more often by connected know- \ners (Carter, 1990). \n\nThe research cited in Table 11.3 suggests that Thinking \ntypes work best if approached from a systematic perspec- \ntive, emphasizing independence and a concern for justice. \nFeeling types, on the other hand, are more motivated if \ntheir field dependence is honored, as well as their concern \nfor eare. With Thinking type students, teachers may be \nmore effective by presenting logical arguments and reasons \nbehind the assignments; with Feeling types teachers may be \nmore effective if they establish a solidly supportive relation- \nship first and do not shrink away if students seek reassur- \nance in the early stages of learning. \n\nThe JudgingPerceiving Dichotomy \n\nJudging types have been found to prefer learning settings \nwith clear structure, motivation, drill, teaching games, and \nindependent study (Fourqurean et al., 1990); sequencing \n(Drummond &amp; Stoddard, 1992); and fact retention, method-",

Two studies (Beyler &amp; Schmeck, 1992; Taggart \netal., 1991) found Judging types oriented to left hemisphere \nkinds of learning and Perceiving types to the right. Academie \nself-esteem was higher for Judging types (Schaefer, 1994), as \nwas academic comfort among female Judging types (Apostal \n&amp; Trontvent, 1989). On the other hand, Perceiving types \nliked tactile learning and loud noise (Fourqurean et al., \n1990) and approaches to learning that are random (Drum- \nmond &amp; Stoddard, 1992), both collaborative and dependent \n(Elliott &amp; Sapp, 1988) and holistic (Beyler &amp; Schmeck, \n1992). They were innovative in creativity, while Judging \ntypes were adaptive (Jacobson, 1993). Goal orientation was \nclearest for Judging types, among both adults and junior \nhigh students (ages 12714) (Atman, 1993). \n\nThe J-P dichotomy of the MBTI identifies how individ- \nuals approach the outer world, with Judging types prefer- \nring planfulness and Perceiving types preferring the flexi- \nbility to wait and see. As the results in Table 11.3 indicate, \nJudging types like to know where they are going and when \nthey will get there. They like it when teachers present a \nplan, and they tend to follow it as given. As we will see in a \nlater section, this probably accounts for their higher \ngrades on the whole. Perceiving types, however, like to \n\nmarch to different drummers. Compared with Judging \ntype classmates, they need more room to roam without \nconstraints, allowing their natural curiosity to remain \nalive. The paradox is that since they look to the outer \nworld to stimulate their curiosity they also may look to \nthe outer world to set guidelines for them, whereas Judg- \ning types will set their own guidelines if no one does it for \nthem. Thus Judging type teachers (who as we shall see \ntend to predominate at all levels of education) can benefit \nall students with their natural sense of closure and organi- \nzation, but for different reasons. Furthermore, teachers \nmay need to be a bit more patient with the initial response \nof Perceiving type students, who may not look as out- \nwardly productive as their Judging type classmates until \nthe due date actually arrives. Unless the deadline is immi- \nnent (meaning a matter of hours away, not days), there are \nso many other interesting things to experience and under- \nstand that the Perceiving types motivation to complete a \nproject has not yet taken hold. \n\nIn 1985 Myers and MeCaulley acknowledged a growing \narea of MBTI research on how students learn that deals \nwith the complexity of type differences. A key example was \nthe study by Eggins (1979), which investigated aptitude by \ntreatment interaction with 350 sixth-grade students (age \nL1 or 12) involved in classifying animals into groups. Sub- \njects were randomly assigned to one of three methods: (a) \nan inductive approach based on Bruners model, which had \nthe least structure; (b) a didactic approach based on \nAusubels advanced organizer model, designed to relate \nalready familiar facts to new concepts; and (c) a highly \nstructured linear presentation based on Gagnes model, \nwhich moved from concrete examples to abstract concepts. \nIntuitive type students benefited most from Bruners induc- \ntive approach. Sensing types who were also field dependent \n(as measured by the Group Embedded Figures Test) \nworked best with Gagnes structured model, while Sensing \ntypes who were field independent responded better to \nAusubels approach. SJ and NJ types succeeded with any of \nthe three models, while SP and NP types were significantly \naffected by the instructional design to which they were \nassigned. The findings from this study help to set the stage \nfor the next section, which deals with the interaction \nbetween learners and teachers. \n\nConclusion \n\nEducators have long known that learners come in various \nkinds. Unfortunately, too often they have pointed the finger \nat some kinds as deficient in comparison with their class- \nmates. The theory and research behind the MBTI shed new \nlight on both the virtues and the potential pitfalls of all \ntypes. The data summarized in this section suggest that, \nespecially pertaining to the S-N dichotomy, students and \nteachers can come to understand better the assumptions and \nneeds associated with different approaches to learning tasks. \n\nTeachers and Teacher-Learner \nInteractions \n\nLearning goes on in context, and the context usually \ninvolves interaction not only with other students but also \nwith instructors. The requirements of the curriculum and \nespecially the characteristies of the teacher play a pivotal \nrole, especially since hierarchy and authority are involved. \nThis section reviews patterns found in MBTI research on \nteachers, their preferred approaches to teaching, and efforts",

Most \nof the available studies deal with one dichotomy at a time. \n\nTeaching Style Patterns \n\nThe following type patterns of teachers are based on a review \not research over a numher of years (Lawrence, 1993). \n\nm Teachers who prefer Extraversion like to give students \nchoices and a voice in decisions, are easily attuned to \nthe attention levels of their students, and have class- \nrooms with movement and noise. Introverts instead \nhave quieter and more orderly classrooms and struc- \ntured learning activities and are more attuned to the \nideas they are teaching than to students attention levels. \n\nm Sensing type teachers tend to emphasize facts, practical \ninformation, and concrete skills; keep learning central- \nized; provide a narrow range of student choices; and \nstart a sequence of questions with a request for facts, \nseeking a predictable response. Intuitive type teachers \ninstead emphasize concepts, relationships, and implica- \ntions; provide a wide range of choices for students and \nencourage their voice in decisions; like to form small \ngroups; expect independence and creative behavior; \nmove freely around the room (especially in elementary \nor middle school settings); have movement and noise in \nthe classroom; and start their questioning of students \nwith an invitation for synthesis and evaluation. \n\nm Thinking type teachers make few comments about stu- \ndent performance, and when they do, it is from an objee- \ntive standard. They attend to the class as a whole and \ninvite students in return to attend to what they (the \nteachers) are doing or saying. Feeling type teachers \ninstead regularly provide both praise and criticism in \ntheir words and body language. They like students to \nspend time on individual work, and they move from stu- \ndent to student to assist them, often attending to more \nthan one student at a time. \n\nm ludging type teachers set and adhere to schedules and \nhave quiet and orderly classrooms. Perceiving type \nteachers, in contrast, encourage movement around the \nclassroom, independent work, open-ended discussion, \nand socializing in groups, and allow students to have a \nvoice in decisions. \n\nUses ol Type in Education. 265 \n\nLawrence (1993) also reported that when students get off \ntask, they do so ditferently depending on the type of their \nteacher. The result is increased. activity and noise with \nExtraverted, Intuitive, and Perceiving tvpe teachers. With \nIntroverted, Sensing, and Judging type teachers, the result is \ndaydreaming, doodling, or withdrawal. Miner &amp; Hyman \n(1988) found that teachers of different types define student \nmisbehaviors differently. Sensing and Thinking types found \nstudent profanity a problem, and Sensing types also saw any- \nthing interfering with instruction as misbehavior. Thinking \nand Judging type teachers identified the most items on a list \not possible student behaviors as problems, and ENFPs the \nlewest. ST type teachers were tound by Amis-Reichle (1995) \nto endorse a belief system that children develop as a result ot \nexternal conditions around them; NF and NT teachers \nbelieved that children develop as a result ot internal factors. \n\nMatching Teachers with Learners by Type \n\nEfforts to match teachers with learners by MBTI profiles \nhave met with mixed results at best. A full review of the lit- \nerature in this area can be found in the education chapter in \nMBTI Applications (DiTiberio, 1996). This review includes \n9 studies on matching and learner satisfaction, 6 of them \nwith no statistically significant findings, and 18 other stud- \nies on matching and learner outcomes, 9 of them lacking \nstatistical significance plus another with results opposite \nthe hypothesized direction. Most were doctoral disserta- \ntions, which perhaps had not been published due to the \nlack of statistical significance. But the general pattern across \nmany studies deserves consideration. \n\nIn the learning styles literature (Guild &amp; Garger, 1985) \nthere is a debate among (a) those who recommend that \nteachers always attempt to match their style of teaching \nwith the needs of the learner, (b) those who believe that \nlearners of all styles should be challenged to meet the \nexpectations of academie standards, and () those who pro- \npose a combination of the two. The results of MBTI studies \nseem to confirm the latter approach. At minimum, it is clear \nthat simple matching by type alone does not guarantee \neither learner satisfaction or successful outcomes. \n\nIt appears that students may need different kinds of \ninstruction at different points in their development. Some \nstudies indeed found that opposite type teachers facilitated \nsignificant learning for the students (Donovan, 199+). Oth- \ners found that matehing with same or similar type instrue- \ntors led to better outcomes (Walter, 1984) or greater stu- \ndent satisfaction (Cooper &amp; Miller, 1991; Lamphere, 1985).",

What had been overlooked \nwere variables that tended to favor Intuitive type students in \nspite of the best intentions of the researchers: three written \nassignments and a final exam in essay format; the content of \nstudy focusing on *Adult Years: Continuity and Change\"; \nand interdisciplinary instruction from psychology, sociology, \ncounseling, history, and literaturc. Furthermore, the authors \nstated that the televised segments \"duplicated neither con- \ntent nor assigned readings, but expanded and enriched . . . \n(p. 39). These findings are similar to those from a study by \nMcCaulley, Godleski, Yokomoto, Harrisberger, and Sloan \n(1983) with engineering students, wherein Sensing types \nperformed better when homework assignments closely \nreplicated the kinds of questions asked on exams, and Intu- \nitive types performed better when they did not. Indeed, \nsome of the early type research on the value of television and \naudiovisual aids (Golanty-Koel, 1978) found that Sensing \ntypes not only appreciate these media in learning but also \nbenefit from having them repeated. \n\nIntuitive instructors who know type theory often find \nthat when Sensing type students ask them to repeat what \nhas just been said, they mean it literally. Instead, Intuitive \ntypes tend to paraphrase, or to say things in other words, \nwhich appeals to their own interest in variety and change. \nSuch an approach can frustrate Sensing types, who, espe- \ncially when under stress in a new subject area, need the \nreassurance that they got it right, which lor them only repe- \ntition can bring. \n\nImplications for the Classroom \n\nThe very mixed results from MBTI researeh suggest that \nmatching teacher type with learner type may be too simple \na solution. Similarly to Cornett (1983), we may conclude \nthat style matching can be strongly supported for affective \nreasons, but overall style matching produces inconsistent \nachievement outcomes\" (p. 41). Barth (1980) also wrote \nthat when teachers are teaching in ways consonant with \ntheir own personal style and professional philosophy, both \n\nthey and their students appear to benefit (p. 15). These \ncomments arc consistent both with MBTI research and with \ntype theory, whieh encourages each individual, whether \nteacher or student, to approach interactions with others by \nfirst drawing on natural strengths, followed then by atten- \ntion to the needs of different others in the interaction. \n\nAcademic Aptitude and Achievement \n\nIn the 1985 MBTI Manual, Myers and McCaulley presented a \ncomprehensive review of decades of study of MBTI profiles \ncompared with standardized test results. The pattern was \nclear: Standardized tests, especially in verbal sections, tend to \nfavor Intuitive types. Written language involves symbols rep- \nresenting aspects of reality. It is an entirely different phenom- \nenon to experience reality directly, as Sensing types tend to \ndo naturally: to see, hear, taste, smell, and touch it. Words, \nphrases, and mathematical formulas are all at least one step \nremoved from the world they are designed to represent. \n\nStandardized Measures of Academic Aptitude \n\nIn research on academic aptitude in the past decade (Schurr \n&amp; Ruble, 1986; Schurr, Ruble, &amp; Henriksen, 1988), verbal \nscores on the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) tend to be con- \nsistently higher for Intuitive types as a group and sometimes \nalso for Introverts and Perceiving types; these patterns essen- \ntially replicate earlier findings (McCaulley, 1977; McCauley",

    "content": "&amp; Kainz, 1974). SAT math scores tend to be higher for \nThinking types (Gallagher, 1988), a pattern also found in \nearlier research (McCaulley &amp; Kainz, 1974). Studies using \nother aptitude instruments present similar findings. With the \nlowa Test of Basic Skills (Fourqurean, Meisgeier, &amp; Swank, \n1988) and the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (Lathey, \n1991; St. Germain, 1988), Intuitive type students as a group \naverage higher scores than their Sensing type classmates. \nMyers and McCaulley (1985) suggested that while occa- \nsional studies show preference for Introversion, Thinking, \nand Perceiving correlating with academic aptitude, the most \nconsistent patterns are found on the S-N dichotomy: As evi- \ndence, Table 11.4 shows the actual means, standard devia- \ntions, t-values, and significance levels for Sensing and Intu- \nitive types across several samples of aptitude measures. \nSamples include students from eighth grade (roughly age 13) \nthrough medical school. It can be seen that in every study \nand for every scale or subscale the mean scores were higher \nfor Intuitive types. There were larger differences for scales \nrequiring higher levels of abstract or verbal ability, and \nsmaller differences for tests of more practical skills. Of the 38 \nscales or subscales studied, 32 were statistically significant. \nIntuitive types are clearly favored on these kinds of measures. \nRequiring a time limit on standardized tests further \nintensifies the distinction between Sensing and Intuition. \n\nTable 11.4 Mean Aptitude Scores for Sensing and Intuition \n\nAptitude Measure \n\nJunior High School Students \n\nCalifornia Test of Mental Maturity! \nOverall IQ \n\nFlorida Eighth Grade Test? \nVocabulary \nComprehension \nComputation \nProblem Solving \nEveryday Living Math \nEveryday Living Reading \nStudy Skills \n\nFlorida Ninth Grade Test? \nVerbal \nQuantitative \nSocial Studies \nEnglish \nMathematics #1 \nMathematics #2 \nScience \n\nFlorida Twelfth Grade Placement Test? \nAptitude \nEnglish \nSocial Studies \nReading Index \nNatural Science \nMathematics \n\nPSAT? \nVerbal \nMathematics \n\nGates Reading Test? \nVocabulary \nComprehension \n\nArmed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery? \nElectrical \nMotor Mechanical \nGeneral Mechanical \nClerical/Administrative \nGeneral Technical \n\nCalifornia Test of Mental Maturity? \n\nIQ \nCollege ond University Students \n\nUniversity of Florida Freshmen and Transfers? \nFlorida Twelfth Grade Placement Test \n\nScholastic Aptitude Test \nMath \nVerbal \nMedical School Students \nMyers Longitudinal Study? \nMedical School Aptitude Test \nVerbal \nQuantitative \n\nGeneral Information \nScience \n\n ti tt tt ttt eee \n\nSensing \n\nN Mean \n118 101.3 \n88 62.0 \n87 62.7 \n89 60.6 \n89 64.0 \n88 20.0 \n89 38.9 \n89 58.9 \np 550 \n97? 57.4 \n92 50.5 \n92 S29 \n22 56.5 \n92 61.6 \n92 47.8 \n48 59 6 \n48 53.2 \n48 49.9 \n48 52.3 \n48 39.9 \n48 61.9 \n38 39.3 \n38 48.6 \n174 St.l \n174 53.6 \n44 37.2 \n40 353 \n40 35.4 \n40 5o \n40 57.4 \n271 | 104.0 \n1.307 387.2 \n56] 544. | \n558 495.4 \n1,994 486.6 \n1,994 506.4 \n1,183 483.5 \n1,992 505.5 \n\n15.4 \n\nSD \n\n14.2 \n\n25.4 \n252 \n25.8 \n26.5 \n\n5.8 \n25:9 \n\n24.1 \n27.1 \n24.0 \n24.2 \n20.2. \n27.8 \n25.1 \n\n26.4 \n27.8 \n22.8 \n254 \n23.3 \n24.5 \n\n8.3 \n11.6 \n\n27.7 \n27.8 \n\nZIT \n18.4 \n20.5 \n16.3 \n16.3 \n\n71.97 \n\n86.84 \n84.03 \n\n83.8 \n22:2 \n88.3 \n86. | \n\n38 \n39 \n\n124 \n124 \n\n1,487 \n\n760 \n747 \n\n2,330 \n2,330 \n1,330 \n2:329 \n\nUses of Type in Education \n\nIntuition \n\nMean \n\n1122 \n\n73:9 \n72:1 \n64.5 \n72.6 \n21.0 \n40.2 \n68.3 \n\nISA \nTRA \n71.8 \n69.9 \n74.7 \n78.1 \n70.0 \n\n7952 \n71.8 \n67.| \n71.4 \n64.0 \n73.6 \n\n51.4 \n56. | \n\n677 \n6/5 \n\n48.4 \n39.7 \n42.8 \n71.4 \n70.0 \n\nEU E \n\n416.9 \n\n565.7 \n540.4 \n\n552.3 \n538.6 \n23.39 \n550.6 \n\nSD \n\n| 3.6 \n\n29:5 \n24.8 \n25.8 \n24.9 \n\n4.9 \n28.8 \n\n214 \n259 \n25.0 \n23.8 \n25.2 \n24.6 \n25.7 \n\nPE \n255 \n28.2 \n25.9 \n29:9 \n275 \n\n11.6 \n14.5 \n\n27.4 \n202 \n\n257 \n18.5 \n16.0 \njer \n20.9 \n\nAl HN. \n\n66.28 \n\n88.42 \n84.89 \n\n933 \n92.0 \n94.7 \n90. | \n\n482\" \n\n2.84\" \n232 \n94 \n2.05* \n|.36 \n1.47 \n214 \n\n5:59 \n4.04*** \nSIGUE \n5E \n455 \nSo ae \n5.54\" \n\n2.76\" \n3.19% \n3.11* \n3.43** \n430** \n2.08\" \n\n5.17 \n2.49 \n\nS.T \n4.03*7 \n\n[27 \n|.00 \n| .64 \n3.16% \n2 457 \n\nBLISS \n\n11.86 \n\n4.42\" \n9.574 \n\n242|** \n| 1.43 \n15.34** \n16.75 \n\n267 \n\nNote: ^p c5: **p &lt;0 sme DO \n\nSource IMay, 1972, ?McCaulley &amp; Natter, 1974, *McCaulley &amp; Kainz, 1974, *McCaulley, 1977. \n\n268 The Uses of Type \n\nSensing often operates slowly in order to be sure, and Intu- \nition is by definition a kind of perception that involves \nflashes of insight, hunches, and quick perception through \nimpressions.

When statistically significant, the correlations were \nin favor of Introversion, Intuition, Perceiving, and some- \ntimes Thinking, and never in the opposite direction. How- \never, the significant correlation values for E-l] and J-P were \nnever above .30 and were infrequently above .20 (5 out ol \n52 investigations for E-l; 4 out of 52 for J-P). When signifi- \ncant on the TF dichotomy, 7 out of 52 investigations were \nabove .20. Only the S-N dichotomy stood out: When sig- \nnificant, 23 out of the 52 investigations were above .20, \nwith .47 the highest correlation value reported. \n\nBecause of the relatively consistent pattern of signifi- \ncance for both the E-1 and S-N dichotomies on aptitude, \nMyers and McCaulley (1985) further reported mean scores \nof IN, EN, IS, and ES types for several samples on aptitude. \nThe theoretical prediction that the means would rank in the \norder of IN &gt; EN &gt; IS &gt; ES was confirmed, a pattern later \nreplicated by Kalsbeek (1987). Myers anel McCaulley added \na note of caution, however: It is important not to conclude \nthat ES types are less intelligent than IN types. Scholastic \naptitude tests measure the I and N aspects of intelligence \nparticularly valued m academic work; they are not designed \nto measure the practical, applied intelligence of E and S\" \n(1985, pp. 109-110). Myers (with Myers, 1980/1995) has \nalso wisely noted that *Ns tend to define intelligence as \nquickness of understanding and... S types... tend to \ndefine intelligence as soundness of understanding \" (p. 59). \nHer profound discussion in those pages suggests that intelli- \ngence is a concept that goes well beyond the limited scope \nof IQ tests or SATs and that Jungs type theory and MBTI \nresearch have much to offer to current debates in this area. \nBack in 1962 Myers wrote of such differences as habits of \nmind\": *[T]he essential difference between IN and ES \nwhich is operative here is a habit of mind which produces, \namong other results, a characteristic level of interest in \nactivities which suit cach type and disinterest in activities \nwhich do not (p. 44). While no studies to date have com- \npared MBTI profiles with measures of multiple intelligence, \n\nthe words of Myers and McCaulley suggest that this would \nbe a fruittul line of future investigation. \n\nAn early study of college freshmen reported by Myers \n(1962) called attention to the influence of timed test condi- \ntions on S-N differences in academic aptitude. Mean scores \non Termans Concept Mastery Test (CMT), an untimed mea- \nsure of high ranges of vocabulary and verbal reasoning, \nfavored both Introverted and Intuitive types, as in other \nstudies. But the advantage of Intuition was primarily found \nin students who also preferred Introversion. Myers reported \nthat this was based in part on the fact that Concept Mas- \ntery is untimed, so that the Intuitives speed is no particular \nasset, and the Introverts depth can be fully utilized \n(p. 36). These findings were also discussed in Myers and \nMcCaulley (1985). \n\nThis study by Myers (1962) is one of several that have \nhighlighted the influence of the clarity of preference on \nmeasures of aptitude. Myers and McCaulley (1985) reported \nthat, with the exception of Sensing, as students preferences \nbecame clearer, average 1Q scores increased. Ihe pattern \nheld true for Extraversion and Introversion, Thinking and \nFecling, and Judging and Perceiving, but only for Intuition \non the S-N dichotomy. At all levels of preference, Sensing \ntypes scored about the same on IQ. The same pattern \nregarding the preference score was also reported as it per- \ntained to achievement, with grades remaining relatively the \nsame at all levels of preference for Sensing but tending to \nincrease with clearer preferences for each of the other MBTI \npolarities. \n\nGrades and Academic Achievement \n\nStudies of type and academic achievement continue to pro- \nliferate, but the results appear to be the same as in earlier \nresearch: Judging types tend to obtain higher grades than \nPerceiving types. Apparently the need for closure and an \norganized approach to external events get results, especially \nin schools where the predominant teacher type also tends \nto be Judging. The pattern seems to be the same whether \ndcaling with high school students (Casey, 1986; Kyle, \n1985), college freshmen (Kalsbeek, 1987; Pollard, 1989; \nProvost, 1985), undergraduates in general (Anchors et al., \n1989; Schurr &amp; Ruble, 1986; Woodruff &amp; Clarke, 1993), \nspecific majors (Tharp, 1992), or first-year medical stu- \ndenis (Neral, 1989).

Comparison of intelligence and Grades \nof the 16 Types in High School \n\nFrom an early study reported by Myers (1962), Figure \n11.1 translates both grades (GPA) and IQ results into stan- \ndard scores for comparison. She cautioned that to obtain \nthe most accurate portrayal of the natural academic behav- \nior of each type, the plots would have to be done at the high \nschool level before dropout, self-selection, or the decisions \nof college admission committees have their effect. Thus the \nmean for each of the 16 types is plotted in this sample of \n3,503 college preparatory males from 27 Pennsylvania high \nschools. The placement of the regression line represents a \ncorrelation of .47 between grades and IQ scores. \n\nFrom this figure, a number of patterns can be observed: \n\nm Judging types have both higher mean grades and higher \nmean 1Q, and Perceiving types get lower grades than \nexpected for their level of IQ. This pattern may be \nobserved by noting that every Judging type but ESFJ \nappears above the line, and every Perceiving type but \nINTP appears below it. Furthermore, for every pairing of \ntypes with the first three letters the same, the Judging \ntype has the higher average grades. \n\nW Intuitive types consistently obtain higher average 1Q \nscores than Sensing types. \n\n8 Ihe three preferences that appear to contribute most to \nsuccess on these two factors (grades and 1Q) are Intro- \nversion, Intuition, and Judging. \n\nm Ihe mean scores for the range of grades extends more \nthan one standard deviation from top (INTJ) to bottom \n(ESFP). However, a more conservative reading would \nnote that the mean grades for all 16 types fall within a \nrange of less than one standard deviation above and below \nthe standard score mean of zero. Thus the advantage of \nIntroversion, Intuition, and Judging is a relative one. \n\nUses of Type in Education 269 \n\nee \n\n*.60 \n\n*.40 \n\n+,20 \n\nGrades (Z Scores) \no \n\nENFP INFP \nesFp  \"ENTP \n220 EST) J4sTP \n*ESFP \nESTP \n\nl \nEN \ne \n\n60 -40 4-20 Do +40 1.60 \nSAT-V (Z Scores) \n\nFigure 11.2 Comparison of Aptitude and Achievement \nof the 16 Types in Liberal Arts \n\nFor comparison, Figure 11.2 shows a similar distribution \nof mean scores for verbal academic aptitude (SAT-V) and \ngrades for liberal arts college students. The range of scores is \nnarrower than lor the high school students in Figure 11.1, \nalthough Introversion, Intuition, and Judging still appear to \nbe favored among the types performing well on both mea- \nsures. Myers and McCaulley (1985) also called attention in \nthis figure to the interesting pattern regarding the T-F \ndichotomy. While Thinking types outscore Feeling types on \nmean grades for those types appearing in the upper half of \nthe sample, the reverse pattern is found in the lower half. The \ncontext of liberal arts seems to draw Thinking types with \nslightly higher aptitude scores than their Feeling type class- \nmates; but when grades are obtained, the advantage of \nThinking is maintained only above the standard score mean \nof zero, below which Feeling then seems to become a favored \npreference. \n\nFigures 11.3 and 11.4 provide further results indicating \nthe interaction of academic context with type, aptitude, and \nperformance. As described by Myers and McCaulley \n(1985), these data show the patterns of 370 medical stu- \ndents using standard scores for both grades and national \nboard scores (in Figure 11.3) and ratings for the same stu- \ndents later in their training by clinical faculty on both med- \nical expertise and enthusiastic involvement in clinical con- \ntacts (in Figure 11.4). While ENFJs obtained lower than \naverage grades and board scores, they became far and away \nthe most outstanding performers in the clinical setting in \nratings of both medical expertise and enthusiasm.

Six \nof the eight Extraverted types were rated high for enthusias- \ntic involvement; three of the four NP types (INFP, INTP, \nENTP), often known as independent spirits, received low \nratings. \n\nThese findings are similar to the patterns reported by \nSchurr, Henriksen, Alcorn, and Dillard (1992), which indi- \ncate that standardized measures, which tend to give read- \nings of broad academic aptitude or general knowledge, may \nnot translate into competence in a chosen field of study. \nThey discovered, for example, that both education and \nnursing students draw a proportionately high number of 5] \ntypes. While these types tend to be outscored by Intuitive \ntypes on both standardized aptitude and first-year grades, \nwhen they persist to graduation they do well and populate \nthe professions of choice. \n\nTables 11.5 and 11.6 show comparisons of ranks of the 16 \ntypes for, respectively, academic aptitude and grades or class \nstanding. These tables include not only the results of early \nstudies reported by Myers and McCaulley (1985) but more \nrccent samples as well. Within each cell of the type table is \nlisted the hypothesized rank based upon Jungs theory of \nhow the various types would be predicted to perform in each \ndomain. For both aptitude (standardized tests) and achieve- \nment (grades or class standing), Introversion, Intuition, and, \nless firmly, Thinking were hypothesized to hold an advan- \nlage, as discussed earlier. The open-minded curiosity of Per- \nceiving types lcads to a theoretical prediction of their advan- \ntage in aptitude; the concern for productivity of Judging \ntypes leads to the hypothesis of higher grades. \n\nZ Scores, Clinical Ratings: Medical Expertise \n\n-6 -4 -2 0 .2 4 6 \nZ Scores, Clinical Ratings: Enthusiastic Involvement \n\nFigure 11.4 Clinical Ratings for Medical Expertise Compared \nwith Clinical Ratings for Enthusiastic Involvement \nin Medical Students \n\nin specific samples, there was occasionally variation \nfrom prediction. However, across the many studies shown \nin Tables 11.5 and 11.6, type theory appears confirmed. \nWith only a few exceptions IN types consistently obtained \nranks, as predicted from theory, as the highest four types for \nboth academic aptitude and grades. The four ES types never \nobtained a top-four ranking for aptitude and only twice \n(both involving ESTJ) appeared in the top four ranks for \ngrades. Perceiving types tended to rank higher on aptitude \nand Judging types on achievement. \n\nImplications for the Classroom \n\nSince the MBTI and Jungs theory hypothesize that type is in \npart inborn, some rather thorny questions naturally emerge \nwhen we examine consistent findings on the aptitude and \nperformance of eertain types. It should be noted, however, \nthat even if the MBTI successfully identifies fundamental \nprocesses that have an innate component, biology is not des- \ntiny. All types can and do behave in varying ways, depending \non the requirements of the situation, the opportunity to \nlearn new skills, and the motivation to do so. The data \nreported on these pages should not be interpreted as an indi- \ncation of an inherent lack in any type. Instead they should \nbe read as indicating that the preferred starting points for \nsome types may tend to put them at a disadvantage without \nfurther intervention, training, support, or challenge. They \nmay also suggest ways to understand the potential biases of \neducators and psychometricians who design and give \nwcight to standardized assessments of this sort. \n\nNote: \n\nTable {1.5 Comparisons of Ranks of the 16 Types by Aptitude \n\nIST) (11) \n\nCollege students SAT-V \nUniv Florida females SAT-V \nBusiness students SAT-M \nAuburn males ACT \n9th-l2th graders IQ \n\nUniv Florida males SAT-V \nAuburn females ACT \n\nBall State females SAT-M \nBall State males SAT-V \nHigh school males IQ \nLiberal arts students SAT-V \nBall State males SAT-M \n\nBall State females SAT-V \nMedical freshmen MCAT-V \n8th graders IQ \n\nEngineering Students SAT-M \n\nISTP (9) \n\nEngineering students SAT-M \nBusiness students SAT-M \n9ch- 12th graders IQ \nAuburn males ACT \nMedical freshmen MCAT-V \nCollege students SAT-V \nHigh school males IQ \n\nBall State females SAT-V \nLiberal arts students SAT-V \nBall State males SAT-M \nUniv Florida females SAT-V \nBall State males SAT-V \n\n8th graders IQ \n\nUniv Florida males SAT-V \nBall State females SAT-M \nAuburn females ACT \n\nISFJ (12) \n\nAuburn males ACT \nEngineering students SAT-M \nBall State males SAT-M \n\nBall State females SAT-M \nAuburn females ACT \n\nBall State females SAT-V \nUniv Florida females SAT-V \nMedical freshmen MCAT-V \nBall State males SAT-V \nHigh school males IC) \n\nUniv Florida males SAT-V \nCollege students SAT-V \n8th graders IQ \n\nLiberal arts students SAT-V \nBusiness students SAT-M \n9th- 12th graders IQ \n\nISFP (10) \n\nCollege students SAT-V \nBall State males SAT-M \nUniv Florida females SAT-V \nBall State males SAT-V \n\n8th graders IQ \n\nLiberal arts students SAT-V",

For example, detail reading favored \nIntroverts and Thinking types, and critical reading favored \nJudging types (Thomason, 1983). Thinking types performed \nbetter in comprehension when reading expository passages \nand Feeling types when reading narratives (Singer, 1989). \n\n(Hester, 1990), reported numbers of books read (Hammer, \n1985; Hicks, 1984, 1985, 1989; Levine, 1988; Moore &amp; \nBayne, 1997), reading comprehension scores on the \nMcGraw-Hill Basic Skills System Reading Test (Thomason, \n1983) and the Nelson-Denny Reading Test (Manske, 1988), \nand proofreading ability (Gordy &amp; Thorne, 1994). In every \ncase Intuitive types had the advantage (except in Hammers \nstudy, where NF types were followed by ST second and NT \nthird in number of books read). These results pertaining to \nthe advantage of Intuition in reading confirm findings from \nearlier studies reported by Myers and McCaulley (1985). \n\nWriting Type theory also appears to be a natural tool for \nwriting instructors (and for writers themselves).

Feeling types also use \npersuasion when asked to write argumentative papers \n(Fisher, 1994). \n\nB Judging types obtain higher ratings for explanatory \nessays in eighth grade (Vondran, 1989), and Percciving \ntypes obtain more average and poor ratings in technical \nwriting (Held &amp; Yokomoto, 1983) and use more words \nper sentence (Carrell &amp; Monroe, 1995; Jensen &amp; \nDiTiberio, 1989). \n\nForeign Language Learning In foreign language learning, \na number of quantitative studies have indicated that In- \ntuitive and Perceiving types perform well. Moody (1988) \nfound Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Perceiving \ntypes most frequent among college students of foreign \nlanguages, while Oxford and Ehrman (1988) found \nExtraverted, Intuitivc, and Percciving types most frequent \namong foreign language professionals. The highest \nlanguage aptitude scores in one study were received by \nIntuitive types (Ehrman, 1995), while Intuitive, Thinking, \nand Perceiving types obtained high proficiency in reading \nand speaking foreign languages in two other studies \n(Ehrman, 1994a; Ehrman &amp; Oxford, 1995). Sensing types \nwere rated among the weakest language learners (Ehrman, \n1994b). Gautsch (1993) found that Perceiving types out- \nscored Judging types on measures of language proficiency \nregardless of the approach to instruction. Ehrman and \nOxford (1990) reported a general language learning \nadvantage for Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Per- \nceiving types. \n\nUses of Type in Education 275 \n\nQualitative Findings \n\nThe results of qualitative interviews have indicated differing \nprocesses for the various types in foreign language learning,",

These kinds of studies remind us of a \ncentral tenet of type theory: that all types have the potential \nfor competence but that their preferred processes may piu \nthem at a temporary disadvantage until they can find a \nmcans (or a mentor) to assist in the transition to the unfa- \nmiliar territory of new learning. \n\nFor example, Ehrman and Oxford (1990) reported that \nSensing types describe language learning as a gradual \nprocess, saying that they like to memorize. They find it frus- \nrating to have to \"guess\" and have a low tolerance for ambi- \nguity. In contrast, Intuitive types tend to be linguistic risk \ntakers and see language learning as often an unconscious \nprocess. In another study (Oxford &amp; Ehrman, 1988), Intu- \nitive and Pereeiving types reported that they like to search for \nand communicate meaning (as did Introverts in another \nstudy by Ehrman &amp; Oxford in 1989), and Intuitive types \nliked formal model building and liked to seek out native \nspeakers with whom they could engage in authentic lan- \nguage use. Affective strategies to overcome the fear of using \nthe new language were most helpful to Extraverts and Intu- \nitive types, while Extraverts also liked visualization as an aid \nto learning. In another study (Ehrman, 1990), NTs were \nfound to be analytical, sometimes to the point of overcom- \nplexity, and liked to build formal models in their learning. In \ncontrast, SEs were not oriented to experimentation, STs pre- \nferred specific goals and objectives and a clearly outlined cur- \nriculum, and NFs, who cited the fewest actual strategies for \nlanguage learning, clearly rejected analysis as one of them. \n\nThe disparity between the performance of Sensing and \nIntuitive types in many academie arenas has been narrowed \nin writing, as reported in several studies. Ferdman and \nDiTiberio (1996), for example, found that eight fifth-grade \nstudents (roughly ages 9-10) who had been identified by \ntheir previous teachers as deficient in writing were all Sens- \ning types as indicated by the MMTIC. However, after six \nmonths of instruction by the first author, taking type prefer- \nences into account, nearly all of these children expressed \nincreased confidence in themselves as writers and were per- \nforming accordingly. Many of the successful type-based \napproaches to writing that had been reported among college \nstudents and adults in previous studies (DiTiberio &amp; Jensen, \n1995; Jensen &amp; DiTiberio, 1984, 1989) were equally useful \nfor working with elementary students. These kinds of case \nstudies confirm that type preferences, while possibly funda- \nmental in an inborn way, do not have to limit ones potential. \n\nImplications for the Classroom \n\nThe general message from research is that effective instruc- \ntion, at least in the area of language literacy, comes from \nacknowledging multiple processes. It appears that the \n\n276 The Uses of Type \n\nMBTI and Jungs theory provide a useful model for under- \nstanding the various activities, stages, and processes that \nlearners go through while acquiring confidence and compe- \ntence as readers, writers, or speakers of either their native \nlanguage or a foreign language. \n\nUsing Type in Elementary \nand Secondary Education \n\nThis section addresses several current issues in the educa- \ntion of different types of children at the elementary \n(roughly ages 5-11) and secondary (roughly ages 12-18) \nlevels, with particular focus on gifted students, learning dis- \nabilities, and behavior disorders. It is wise to note first that \nprofessionals in education, whether classroom teachers or \nadministrators, tend predominantly to prefer Judging at all \nlevels, usually by a ratio of two to one (Diliberio, 1996; \nLawrence, 1993; Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985). Given the \nnature of schools as organizations, this is not surprising. \nThere are implications of this finding when attending to dif- \nferent processes in learning, however. Educators need to \nacknowledge both the virtues and the potential pitfalls of \neach, including, as one example, Judging and Perceiving \napproaches alike. \n\nGifted Students \n\nA recent study dealing with learners identified as academi- \ncally talented (Mills et al., 1996) found that in using the \nMurphy-Meisgeter Type Indieator for Children (MMTIC) \nwith these students in grades 3 through 6 (roughly ages \n8-11), ENFP types were disproportionately represented \ncompared with their frequency in the general population. \nENFPs were also more frequent than in an older sample \n(which used the MBTI) of academically talented students in \ngrades 8 through 10 (roughly ages 13-15). Mills et al. \nfound a slight gender difference, with males appearing \nmore frequently as Extraverted and females as Introverted. \nSince the same criteria were used to designate these gifted \nstudents at the two levels, the authors questioned whether \nprofiles from the MMTIC can faithfully be compared with",

The question clearly deserves further \nstudy and echoes Murphy's (1992) suggestion that type in \nyoung children should be considered in light of their devel- \nopmental exploration, not as an established set of *truc \ntype\" preferences. \n\nNevertheless, these same preferences for Extraversion, \nIntuition, Feeling, and Perceiving have been found to char- \nacterize gifted learners in other studies, such as the one \nby Williams (1992) with students aged 7 through 19. \nDelbridge-Parker and Robinson (1989) found Intuitive, \nThinking, and IN types to be predominant among academ- \nically gifted junior high students (ages 12-14), and Wittig, \n\nSchurr, &amp; Ruble (1986) found Intuition but also Introver- \nsion and Feeling to characterize students in the honors col- \nlege at a state university. Introversion, Intuition, Thinking, \nand Perceiving were the most frequent preferences for stu- \ndents attending a national Academic Decathlon competi- \ntion (Robinson, 1994). These studies confirming Intuition \nas  process consistently favored among academically \ngifted students replicate findings reported originally by \nMyers (1962) for junior high school students. \n\nBecause type theory posits potential strengths of all types, \nresults from the MBTI or the MMTIC provide a means for \nunderstanding the possible contextual biases that tend to \ndiscriminate against otherwise very capable students. Gifted- \nness is often defined in language that mirrors the natural \npreferences of Intuitive types. However, Robinson's (1994) \nstudy produced some interesting contrasts for Sensing types. \nWhile in the minority overall among these Academic \nDecathlon participants, ST and SP types were overrepre- \nsented in percentage when compared with samples of \nNational Merit Finalists. The direct activity (for SPs) and \ncompctitive atmosphere (for STs) of this medium might \ndraw very capable Sensing types that other means of assess- \ning academic strengths do not. In another interesting study, \nChiang (1991) asked gifted learners to rate the effectiveness \nof their teachers. Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, and Judg- \ning type teachers were given the highest ratings. The rating \nform, however, listed the following characteristics as \noptions: organization, classroom management, teaching \nskill, course impact, student participation, and rapport. \nOpen-ended questions pertaining to these successful teach- \ners received the following comments from students: speaks \nclearly, shows energy and excitement, uses concrete \nexamples, and presents thought-provoking ideas. \n\nLearning Disabilities and Behavior Disorders \n\nLearning and behavior disorders have been examined in sev- \neral studies through the lens of type. Conduct-disordered \nstudents were found not to vary in type preference from the \ngeneral population of students, but emotionally disturbed \nstudents included higher percentages of Introverted, Think- \ning, IJ, IB, ST, and IS types (Kelly, 1991). Students labeled \nwith attention deficit disorder (ADD) did not differ by type \nfrom the general student body, and subsamples of ADD stu- \ndents with and without hyperactivity also did not vary by \ntype (Meisgeier, Poillion, and Haring, 1994). But ADD stu- \ndents did differ from their teachers in that they included \ndisproportionately higher percentages of Extraverted, Sens- \ning, Feeling, and Perceiving types. Other studies pertaining \nto learning disabilities produced mixed results, perhaps due \nto varied criteria for determining these labels. It is clear that \nthese studies deserve replication and that further links \nshould be examined pertaining to a deeper understanding \nof the intersection of type with learning and behavior disor- \nders in school settings. \n\nImplications for the Classroom \n\nEducators are likely to continue differentiating among stu- \ndents according to categories such as those just highlighted. \nBoth MBTI research and Jungs type theory, however, pro- \nvide important cautions about the dangers of restrictive \nlabels that favor some students to the neglect of others. It \nwas perhaps with this in mind that Myers enutled her book \nGifts Differing (with Myers, 1980/1995). \n\nUsing Type in Higher Education \n\nProfessionals in higher education continue to find a broad \nrange of applications of the MBTI. They include investiga- \ntions into academic persistence and student retention, \nextracurricular activities, student leadership, and resi- \ndence life. \n\nAcademic Persistence and Student Retention \n\nRetention in both college and professional education are \nregular concerns of campus administrators. Type differ- \nences seem to relate to how students move successfully \nthrough college. For example, a study by Schurr, Ruble, \nPalomba, Pickerill, and Moore (1997) conducted a follow- \nup of students 10 years after they entered a midwestern uni- \nversity. A higher overall persistence-to-graduation rate was \nfound for Sensing and Judging types, but as in previous",

What was most notable \nfrom this study was the fact that persistence to graduation \nwas often the result of an indirect influence of type by way \nof intermediary factors: Judging through academic and \nvocational orientations, Sensing through a vocational orien- \ntation and choice of an applied major field, and Extraver- \nsion with a collegiate orientation, defined as having a loy- \nalty to the college and valuing extracurricular life. The \nauthors concluded that high levels for some aspects of the \ntotal college experience can offset lower levels for other \naspects in determining whether students will persist to \ngraduation (p. 40). \n\nThese findings by Schurr et al. (1997) confirm the \nwords of Myers and McCaulley (1985), who wrote that \ndata on academic achievement report only the end prod- \nuct of these positive or negative learning experiences. \nBecause of the many and conflicting influences on learn- \ning, correlations of personality variables with academic \nachievement are typically low\" (p. 102). \n\nThe focus of the academic and social context with which \nstudents interact seems to be a critical factor, especially in \nprofessional education. Often the types of students who are \nin the minority or whose preferences diverge from the focus \n\nUses of Type in Education 277 \n\nof the curriculum tend to drop out. This was found for \nFeeling, NE and FP types at the U.S. Naval Academy \n(Roush, 1989), NF types in engineering (McCaulley, 1990a), \nand Thinking types in nursing (Kalsbeek, 1987). Other \nresearchers have conversely called attention to those types \nmost likely to succeed or to persist to graduation, whose \npreferences tend to be congruent with the focus of the \nmajor field: ITJ in engineering (Rosati, 1997), TJ in law \n(Gilchrist, 1991), Sensing, Fecling, and Judging in family \nmedicine and Sensing in obstetrics (Friedman &amp; Slatt, \n1988), Judging in dentistry (Erskine, Westerman, &amp; \nGrandy, 1986), and 5] in nursing (Schurr et al., 1992). \n\nAside from professional specialties, however, the general \natmosphere of higher education also appears to be more \nconducive to success for some types than for others. Mac- \ndaid, Kainz, and McCaulley (1984) analyzed data on attri- \ntion in a 10-year follow-up at the University of Florida. IST] \nand ISFJ types had the highest rate of graduation, while \nESTP, ENTP, and ISTP types significantly more often had \nnot graduated. FJ types were likely to have graduated early \nand TP types late; NT types were most likely and ES types \nleast likely to have attended graduate school. Schurr, Ruble, \nand Henriksen (1989) applied the revised admissions stan- \ndards at a midwestern university to data on students admit- \nted previously who had successfully made progress through \ntheir programs; they found a significant. number of \nExtraverted and SP types among those who would have \nbeen denied admission by the new standards. They also \ncalled attention to the relatively low SAT scores of SJ types, \nwho, once admitted, persisted beyond expectation toward \ngraduation, in large measure due to their finding applied \nmajor fields that channeled their interests and energies. \n\nA promising line of research in higher education settings \nis represented by the work of Lynch and Sellers (1996). \nThey asked students to indicate the characteristics of their \npreferred learning environments from descriptions written \nto reflect ES, IS, EN, and IN patterns. Both adult learners \nand traditional-age college students tended to prefer en- \nvironments consistent with their own type preferences. \nHowever, overall there was a general preference for ES envi- \nronments, with IN environments least preferred overall, es- \npecially for adult learners. \n\nExtracurricular Activities \n\nType theory helps us to understand the various kinds of \nmotivations and rewards that facilitate the successful move- \nment of different types through college. It certainly appears \nto help to have found an area of study congruent with ones \ntype. This may perhaps be due to a greater number of kin- \ndred spirits among ones classmates. It also may relate to the \nexpectations of instructors and the curriculum. However, \nthe fact that other types, albeit in smaller numbers, succeed \nin a particular discipline suggests that nonacademic factors \nmay also be at work, as this section will address. \n\n278 The Uses of Type \n\nThe Extraversion-Introversion Dichotomy As entering \nfreshmen, Extraverts predicted that they would get involved \nin campus life, live in coed housing, and participate in Greek \nactivities, while Introverts, who said they anticipated working \nwhile in college (Provost &amp; Anchors, 1987), obtained higher \ngrades among persisting students (Anchors ct al., 1989).

Extraverts also tended to \ndevelop a sense of autonomy and purpose and mature \ninterpersonal relationships (Anchors &amp; Robinson, 1992). At \ntheir worst, however, Extraverts were found to be frequent \namong campus judicial offenders (Griffin &amp; Salter, 1993) as \nwell as among those with substance abuse records, as were \nIntuitive and Perceiving types (Anchors &amp; Dana, 1989; \nBarrineau, 1997; Provost, 1991). \n\nThe Sensing-Intuition Dichotomy Because of the \nincreasingly abstract nature of much of academic life, \nSensing and Intuitive types vary greatly in their needs for \nextracurricular activity. Sensing type students in college \nwere found to be frequent among male scholarship athletes, \nas were Thinking, Perceiving, and ISTP types (Chesborough, \n1994). Sensing types were similarly found to participate in \nathletics in general (Ruble, Mahan, &amp; Schurr, 1987) and \n\nto frequent college basketball games (Schurr, Ruble, &amp; | \n\nEllen, 1985; Schurr, Wittig, Ruble, &amp; Ellen, 1988). As \nentering freshmen, they foresaw marriage as part of the \ncollege experience (Provost &amp; Anchors, 1987). Intuitive \ntypes, in contrast, valued the increase in individual self- \nesteem they gained by participating in an outdoor \nadventure course, as did Feeling and Perceiving types \n(Taylor, 1990). As entering freshmen, Intuitive types \nanticipated academic achievement (Provost &amp; Anchors, \n1987), perhaps assuming that college would provide the \nkinds of supports and challenges conducive to their \npreferred ways of approaching life. \n\nThe ThinkingFeeling Dichotomy Thinking types, like \nExtraverts and Perceiving types, were found frequent \namong judicial offenders (Griffin &amp; Salter, 1993), and \nThinking types were among those with substance abuse \nrecords, similar to Extraverted, Intuitive, and Perceiving \ntypes (Anchors &amp; Dana, 1989). Thinking types also liked to \nparticipate in physical activities such as basketball, track, \nand cross-country, while Fecling types preferred instead to \nparticipate in volleyball, softball, field hockey, and \ngymnastics, regardless of gender (Wittig, Schurr, Ruble, &amp; \nEllen, 1994). At their worst, Feeling type college students, \nespecially INFPs, were found to indicate that they had had \nsuicidal thoughts significantly more often than other types \n(Komisin, 1992). \n\nThe Judging-Perceiving Dichotomy Judging types were \nfound to have higher grades among students who persisted \nin college (Anchors et al., 1989) and among scholarship \nathletes in particular (Chesborough, 1994). In contrast, \neven as they entered college as freshmen, Perceiving types \nreported that they considered the possibility of dropping \nout (Provost &amp; Anchors, 1987). Among those on academic \nprobation, EP types were found the most frequent, and TP \nand INTP types were highest among thosc with drug \nviolations (Provost, 1991). \n\nStudent Leadership and Residence Life \n\nStudent leaders, including resident assistants (RAs), tend \nconsistently to prefer Judging, usually in combination with \nExtraversion and often also with Thinking (Anchors &amp; Hay, \n1990; Brush, 1989; Hardy-Jones &amp; Watson, 1990; Petty, \n1985). As seen in Table 11.1, ENFJ, EST], and ENT] types \npredominate among RAs. These patterns suggest that lead- \nership roles in col *ge settings tend to attract the types of \nstudents who like to take charge ( Judging) and who bring \nnoticeable energy to the activities they are engaged in \n(Extraverts). \n\nA number of studies have been completed on the uses of \nMBTI results as one factor in matching roommates (Carey, \nHamilton, &amp; Shanklin, 1985, 1986; Jackson, 1985; Kals- \nbeek, Rodgers, Marshall, Denny, &amp; Nicholls, 1982; \nSchroeder &amp; Jackson, 1987). The results have been mixed, \nal times identifying apparent success and at other times \nlacking significant findings. One interesting pattern that \ncalls attention to the complexity of matching was seen in \nJacksons (1985) study, which reported that identical \nmatches (dominant and auxiliary the same), while success- \nful, were superseded in terms of higher student grades by \ncomplementary pairings (dominant the same, auxiliary \ndifferent). These latter findings are similar to those \nreported carlicr on teacher-student matching by type \n(Boyd, 1995), whereby matching students with teachers of \nthe same type was less successful than when one MBTI \ndichotomy was different. \n\nImplications for the Classroom \n\nType theory and MBTI results have proven to be of use in a \nwide varicty olf ways in higher education.

Higher education professionals who are \nconcerned about retention of students may consider type \ntheory as one way of understanding the students diversity \nof needs. \n\nThe traditional ethic of hard work seems suited to some \ntypes (Introverted and Judging especially). The fact that col- \nlege and university administrators tend to favor Judging may \ntend to reinforce this pattern (DiTiberio, 1996), and these \n\nfindings have been replicated among female deans and vice \npresidents of student affairs (Daugherty, Randall, &amp; Glo- \nbetti, 1997). But other types of students appear to do better \nwith active engagement in campus life (Extraverts). Still \nothers prefer much less extracurricular activity (IP and ISTP \nespecially). Another group appears at risk for academic pro- \nbation or other disciplinary action unless their need for \nspontaneous play can be constructively channeled (EP and \nTP types especially). A knowledge of the strengths as well as \nthe potential pitfalls of each MBTI type can help determine \nthe appropriate balance between challenge and support \nregarding activity and privacy (E-I), practical involvement \nand conceptual inspiration (S-N), competition and human \nconnection (TF), or structure and freedom (J-P). \n\nType and Cultural Differences \nin Education \n\nChapter 15 addresses the widening MBTI literature on \ncross-cultural differences by type. This section, however, \ncalls aitention to studies that point to such differences in \neducational settings. Issues of diversity are of increasing \nimportance as educators prepare students for the multiple \ndemands of dealing with todays complex world. This sec- \ntion shows how type theory can assist in translating the var- \nious \"languages\" used by different cultural groups in col- \nleges and universities, high schools, and elementary \neducation. Each subsection begins with a brief report of the \nfrequency of types by students cultural grouping, which is \nfollowed by a discussion of the implications for educators. \n\nCollege and University Settings \n\nIn college and university settings, preference for Sensing \nand Thinking appears to characterize African Ameriean stu- \ndents in higher percentages than for Whites (Hill &amp; Clark, \n1993; Johnson, 1990; Levy, Murphy, &amp; Carlson, 1972). \nSamples of Black females especially tend to contain higher \npereentages of Thinking types (Harrison, 1995; Hill &amp; \nClark, 1993). ISTJ was found to be overrepresented and \nENFP underrepresented among African Amerieans (Hill &amp; \nClark, 1993). International students coming to American \ncolleges were found by Fu (1992) to report better social and \nemotional adjustment if they preferred Extraversion; a pref- \nerence for Thinking was favored by those with better physi- \ncal health. \n\nThese findings suggest either that the overall distribution \nol types varies across cultural groups or that in order to meet \nthe requirements for entering college, students from minor- \nity groups who report preference for the practical (Sensing) \nand the logical (Thinking) survive the best. Either way, it \nwould help faculty and other higher education profession- \nals, who tend to prefer Intuition, to provide a balance in \n\nUses of Iype in Education 279 \n\ntheir work between their natural value for the imaginative \nand the abstract on the one hand and real-life applications \nof learning. While these suggestions were made carlier in \nthe chapter for underserved types in general, the recom- \nmendations may have additional implications for cross- \ncultural understanding. \n\nHigh School Settings \n\n[In high schools (roughly ages 15-18), Ross (1994) found \nthat Extraversion predicted academic achievement among \nBlacks, contrary to findings for Whites. Melear and Richard- \nson (1994) found higher percentages of Perceiving, EP, SP, \nand TP types among high school African American males, \nwhile May (1992) found higher percentages of SP types \namong male African Americans in high school but not \namong females. \n\nIntroverted, Intuitive, and Judging types have been \nfound more likely to appear among students in general with \nhigh academic achievement at all levels. However, these \nstudies of high school African Americans suggest that edu- \ncators may benefit from attending to the varied learning \nstyles of different ethnic groups. Serious reflection (Intro- \nversion) and structure ( Judging) can be balanced, respec- \ntively, by opportunities for physical and spoken interaction \n(Extraversion) and spontaneous playfulness or inquisitive- \nness (Perceiving). \n\nElementary and Middle School Settings \n\nSimilar findings emerge in elementary (roughly ages 5-11) \nand middle (roughly ages 11-14) school settings using the \nMurphy-Meisgeier Type Indicator for Children (MMTIC). \nMay (1992) found that SP types predominated among both",

Tobaeyk and col- \nleagues reported in one study (Tobacyk, Wells, &amp; Springer, \n1988) that Extraversion, Sensing, Feeling, and Judging \ndescribed students at risk lor dropout and in another (Toba- \ncyk, Hearn, &amp; Wells, 1990) that Sensing, Thinking, and \nJudging described a similar group; nearly all the students in \nthese rural junior high schools (roughly ages 12-14) were \nAlrican American. Hispanic fourth- and fifth-grade students \n(roughly ages 9-10) were found by Fourqurean et al. \n(1990) not to differ from White samples on the four \nMMTIC dichotomies. However, Rosin (1995) reported that \nCree junior high students tended to preter SP in dispropor- \ntionate percentages compared with broader samples. \n\nMuch has been written about the challenges Sensing \ntypes face as they move up the academic ladder (Myers \nwith Myers, 1980/1995). The results of these studies on SP \nand SJ types across cultural groups call our attention to a \nfurther refinement. As especially discussed by Fairhurst \nand Fairhurst (1995), teachers can provide either concrete \n\n280 The Uses of Type \n\nstructure (SJ) or concrete adaptability (SP). The results \nmay redress a common oversight in instruction not only \nfor different personality types but for students from various \ncultures as well. \n\nImplications for the Classroom \n\nThe issuc of diversity in education is illuminated when type \ndifferences are taken into account. Variations among stu- \ndents, formerly characterized as the primary result of cul- \nture or gender, may also be understood in terms of type. \nStudies pertaining to type by gender were reported in an \nearlier section on characteristics of learners, especially \nrelating to the Thinking-Feeling dichotomy. Type theory \nrelieves the pressure to change student characteristics that \nmay be fundamental and intrinsic to the individual. The \ntheory of type development further provides suggestions \nfor how and when to nurture the acquisition of new skills \nand behaviors by different kinds of students. \n\nIt is wise, however, to be careful not to stereotype stu- \ndents by culture, gender, or psychological type. Educators \nmust ultimately deal with individual students, who often \nvary from others of their ethnic background, gender, or \ntype. Furthermore, students must be provided not only \nsupport for their preferred learning styles but also challenge \nto learn skills that do not come casily and naturally. An \nappreciation of both differences and developmental needs \ncan help educators to seek an optimum balance. \n\nlt is equally dangerous to assume that type theory can \naccount for all differences, including those pertaining to \nculture or gender. It cannot. As comprehensive as Jungs \ntheory may be, students and their families from various cul- \ntures can inform educators about the values they hold, the \nbehaviors they admire, the beliefs they cherish, and their \nunique ways of viewing and understanding the world. \n\nAdministering and Interpreting \nthe MBTI in Educational Settings \n\nChapters 5 and 6 of this manual should be consulted by \nanyone intending to administer and interpret the MBTI. \nThey provide standard conditions necessary for the wise \nand ethical uses of the instrument in most scttings. This \nsection addresses issues of particular concern to educators, \ncach framed by a question. \n\nl. Is it necessary to administer the MBTI or the \nMMTIC in order to use type concepts in education? \nNo, it is not. Teachers, counselors, coaches, and other \ncducators effectively make usc of type theory in a vari- \nety of ways without having profiles for the people with \nwhom they interact. The following guidelines can help: \n* Read carefully the descriptions of type dichotomies \n\nand the 16 types in sourees such as Gifts Differing \n(Myers with Myers, 1980/1995). \n\n* Acknowledge your own preferred ways of gather- \ning information and making decisions while teach- \ning, counseling, coaching, and so forth. \n\n* Notice when students, colleagues, or others with \nwhom you are working do and do not respond as \nyou intended to your presentation, instructions, or \ncxpectations. \n\ne Based on your own preferences on the four \ndichotomics, find a way to translate your inten- \ntions into language more understandable by some- \none with an opposite preference. For example, \nSensing teachers may lose the attention of Intu- \nitive students by too carefully repeating every step \nof an assignments instructions. If instead they first \npoint to the overall goal of the assignment (the \ngeneral theme or its purpose), the Intuitive stu- \ndents may be more likely to return to the interme- \ndiary steps. Conversely, an Intuitive teacher work- \ning with a Sensing student may need to slow down \nthe explanation, carefully repeating each step in",

Usually \nthrough a sequential understanding of the parts, \nthe Sensing type is more inclined to understand \nthe end goal of the assignment. \n\n* Be wary of interpreting every behavior of another \nperson as indicating type. Watch instead for gen- \neral patterns over time in different settings as possi- \nble indications of type. Students and teachers alike \nare somctimes inclined to behave according to their \nsettings expectations (either real or imagined) in \norder to accommodate or to learn new skills. \n\n2. Do 1 need 10 take the MBTI myself in order to \n\nunderstand how to use type concepts in education? \nIt certainly helps. The first step in using type theory is \nto understand how it works for oneself. The MBTI \nwas designed to assist in this process and can provide \na reliable hypothesis regarding your type. \n\n. Do I need special training before { can use the \n\nMBTI? \n\nYes, you do. A college-level course in psychological \ntests and measurements, or its equivalent, is the mini- \nmum prerequisite for purchasing a Level B instrument \nsuch as the MBTI. The course should preferably deal \ndirectly with the MBTI. If not, it is recommended that \nyou attend one of a number of approved MBTI training \nprograms. You can get a list from the publisher: Con- \nsulting Psychologists Press (1-800-624-1765). \n\n4. What form of the MBTI is best for my educational \n\nsetting? \n\nReading level is the most important criterion here. \nMBTI Form M is currently the standard instrument \nfor individuals with a reading level of cighth grade \n(roughly age 13) and higher. The Murphy-Meisgeicr \nType Indicator for Children (MMTIC) has been \ndesigned for students in elementary and middle \nschool settings with a reading level of second grade \n\n(roughly age 7) through seventh grade (roughly age \n12). There are also a number of translations of the \nMBTI into foreign languages such as Spanish, \nFrench, German, Korean, and others; see Chapter 14 \nin this manual and Chapter 8 of MBTI Applications \n(Kirby &amp; Barger, 1996) for suggestions on how to \nuse them. \n. A colleague told me that there are short forms of \nthe MBTI in a number of books that are easy to \nadminister to students. Can't I use one of these? \nOnly to help you to read the book. In most cases the \nauthors explicitly state that these checklists or ques- \ntionnaires are not expected to be reliable or valid \nassessment tools. Decades of research have instead \ngone into refining the sube wording needed to \nassess a persons type preferences on each dichotomy \nby way of the MBTI. \n\n. What are legitimate uses of the MBTI in working \n\nwith students? \n\nThe possibilities are many, but they may include the \n\nfollowing: \n\n* To assist students to understand themselves and \ntheir preferred ways of going about learning, thus \nenhancing self-confidence \n\n* To help students working with one another to \nrecognize the value of different perspectives and \napproaches to teamwork \n\n* To help students who face blocks in learning to \napproach such tasks by first drawing upon their \nnatural strengths, thus saving energy for greater \ndifficulties later on \n\n* [o assist fellow teachers, counselors, and other \nprofessionals in education to recognize differ- \nences among students as potential sources of \nsirength rather than as impediments to learning \n\n* To employ the theory of type development as one \nway to understand normal transitions through \nwhich different types of students (and teachers) \ntend to proceed \n\n. What uses of the MBTI with students should be \n\navoided? \n\nSimply recognizing that type theory and MBTI results \n\ncan be misused can alert us to problems such as those \n\nindicated below. \n\ne Stereotyping based on MBTI profile results, as in \nassuming that a person of a certain type always \noperates in his or her preferred way. \n\n* Emphasizing the pitfalls of a type to the neglect of \nstrengths, as in faulting the slowness of a Sensing \ntypes information-gathering process while ignor- \ning the sureness and confidence that comes from \ntheir careful observation, or conversely in faulting \nthe randomness of an Intuitive types ideas about \nan assigninent while ignoring the inspiration and \nenthusiasm that comes from their brainstorming. \n\nUses of Type in Fducanon 281 \n\n* Selecting or rejecting students (for example, for \ngroup participation or promotion to a higher level) \nbased on type preferences, since type alone does \nnot account for ones potential to contribute well \nor poorly in a given situation. Lawrence (1993) \nwisely wrote that to use the MBTI as a screening \ndevice is usually fruitless and often harmful \n(p. 92). The harm comes in treating type prefer- \nences as barriers rather than possibilities. The \nfruitlessness may result either from falsification of \nanswers to MBTI questions if the student expects \nscreening is to occur or from factors beyond type \nthat may affect motivation or performanee. \n\n* Using type preferences as an excuse or a rational-",

They instead become more \ndiverse and well-rounded examples of their inborn \ntype. \n\n* Imposing ones enthusiasm for type theory and the \nMBTI. Type cannot provide answers for all prob- \nlems in education, no matter how useful it may be. \nEven in those arenas where it has been found help- \nful, other teachers, students, and administrators \nmay have equally useful ways to deal with diver- \nsity in their work. \n\n8. What must l keep in mind while administering the \n\nMBTI to students? \n\nThe following factors may either enhanee or interfere \n\nwith your purposes. \n\n* The MBTI works best if completed voluntarily. \n\ne Because teachers, counselors, or other profession- \nals who administer the MBTI hold authority posi- \ntions, students may respond as they believe they \nShould: it is wise to rcad the instructions to \nthem, which emphasize that there are no right or \nwrong answers to any of the questions. \n\n282 \n\nThe Uses of Type \n\nThe expectations of the school, the curriculum, or \nprofessional standards may invite an acceptable \nchoice, thus leading to lalsification of ones report \nof type. \n\nBecause the MBTI looks like a test, students may \nassume, on the one hand, that they have to answer \nevery item carefully to get it right or, on the \nother hand, that they must move more quickly \nthan they prefer in order to finish on time; the \ninstructions note that respondents should go at \ntheir own pace, that there is no time limit, and that \nthey may skip items about which thev are not sure. \nStudents should be assured that their results will \nbe kept confidential and not shared without their \nconsent, preferably written; once they hear or read \nthe positive language of their own type deserip- \ntion, most students are eager to share their pro- \nfiles, but thev should not feel coerced to do so. \nProfile results and feedback on their meaning \nshould always be given face to face by a trained \nprofessional, never distributed by mail or through \nan untrained third party; respondents thus have \nthe opportunity to raise questions about the profile \nand to validate personally whether it truly refleets \ntheir type preferences. \n\nStudents should be encouraged to verify for them- \nselves the degree to whieh the profile fits them, \neven if their perceptions seem to contradict what \nthe teacher, the counselor, or classmates think is \ntrue for them; other people may have misread \nprior behavior and thus may have an inaccurate \ninterpretation of the students type, or the student \nmay need time to digest the feedback before com- \ning to a clearer view of his or her type. \n\nSometimes students feel torn between a school \nself and a home self or even an ideal self: \nthey should be encouraged to explore these vari- \nous expressions of a hroader \"best-fit type\" (see \nChapter 6 for more on that concept). \n\nYounger students may not always identify with the \nwording of some items, which may pertain more \nto adult situations; they should be encouraged to \nanswer as they best understand the situation or to \nleave the item blank. \n\nSimilarly, if students ask the meaning of a word or \nphrase they should be encouraged to answer as \nbest they can or to leave it blank; words or phrases \nshould not be explained. \n\nWhile generally reliable across most settings, thc \nMBTI, like all self-report instruments, may some- \ntimes be neither reliable nor valid for certain \ngroups, such as those academically at risk or with \nlow reading levels. See Chapter 8 for reliability \ndata on such groups. lf the MBTI is used with \nthese individuals, extra time should be devoted to \n\nhelp them explore their best-fit type beyond the \nprofile results. \n\n* Sometimes educators bring unrealistic expecta- \ntions to the administration of the MBTI. MBTI \nresults should never be used alone to determine a \npersons best ways of approaching educational \ntasks; the influence of factors such as gender, age,",

Statistically significant research indicates that some \ntypes get higher grades or aptitude scores than their \nopposites. Should I therefore expect less of some \ntypes? \n\nAbsolutely not. There are three main reasons why this \n\nreasoning is dangerous. \n\ne First, it is risky to generalize from statistically sig- \nnificant research findings to all people of a type. \nEven though Judging types tend as a group to get \nhigher grades than Perceiving types and Intuitive \ntypes higher standardized aptitude scores than \nSensing types, you may be working with students \nwhose performance belies the general pattern. \nThere are many individual Perceiving types with \nthe highest possible grades, as well as Sensing \ntypes who outperform most of their Intuitive elass- \nmates on standardized tests. \n\ne Next, factors in addition to a students type may \ncontribute to the findings. For example, we know \nthat a majority of teachers from the earliest ele- \ninentary grades through graduate school faculty \nprefer Judging; thus high grades for Judging stu- \ndents may result from a more compatible match \nthan for Perceiving students, not from ability \nalone. Similarly, we know that standardized tests \nare usually designed by academically minded psy- \nchologists, a large proportion of whom are Intu- \nitive types. \n\n* Finally, type theory affirms the potential of all \ntypes to perform well in any setting given the \nmotivation and the opportunity to do so.

Indeed, the present review of rescarch \nhas continued to report the affinity of Intuitive types for \nactivities usually associated with academic success: stan- \ndardized aptitude scores; grades in college, especially in the \nfirst year; proficiency measures in reading, writing, foreign \nlanguage learning, and sometimes mathematics; high per- \ncentages among gifted students at all levels; nominations as \nteacher of the year among college facultythe list goes on. \n\nlt is not enough for educators to point to other chapters \nof this manual to identily areas of success for Sensing types, \nsuch as business careers, some health professions, and the \nlike. What need to be examincd intensively are the arenas \nwithin academic life where Sensing types thrive and where \nIntuitive types tend to slack off (even though they often still \nsurvive due to flashes of insight through verbal expressive- \nness). Robinson (1994) found competitive and active \naspects ol the relatively elite Academic Decathlon competi- \ntion to appeal to SP types, who in most studies are among \nthose most at risk. Provost (1985) interviewed ISTPs \namong students who had persisted to successful comple- \ntion ol college and lound that not being involved in campus \nsocial life helped them do well, opposite the finding for \nother types. These and studies like them need to be repli- \ncated so that educators can take seriously the admonition of \nMyers (Myers with Myers, 1980/1995) that in education, as \nin all settings, one must deal with variations of giftedness, \nnot simply one kind. \n\nSeveral research tools can be employed to bring the \nabove elfort to fruition. Since type theory is dynamic, fur- \nther research taking the 16 types into account is clearly \ncalled for. The design of Harrison and Lawrence (1985) \nprovides a prototype: Hypotheses were driven by Jungian \ntheory, and responses were solicited from each of the 16 \ntypes to the question of study (in this case projections into \nones personal future). Other studies have involved inten- \nsive qualitative interviews to explore how individuals ol a \ngiven type respond to educational settings, as done, lor \ncxample, by Provost, Carson, and Beidler (1987) with out- \nstanding college professors, by Ferdman and DiTibcrio \n(1996) with fifth-grade writers, and by Ehrman (1990) with \nforeign language professionals. \n\n&gt; \n\nd \n\n84 \n\nThe Uses of Type \n\nSome important cautions have been discovered from this \n\nreview of the MBTI literature. Simplistic applications ol \n\nMBTI profiles by way of matching teachers with students, \nfor example, produce at best mixed results. Human person- \nality differences appear to be sufficiently complex that vari- \nables beyond type must be considered. As the recent study \nby Schurr et al. (1997) points out, MBTI preferences arc \nbest conceptualized as contributing to academic success by \ninteraction with other variables. Thus a strict linear cause- \ncffect approach to MBTI rescarch would appear to producc \nlimited results. \n\nWhere possible, MBTI distributions for a sample should \nbe compared with distributions of related groups through \nselection ratio type table analysis (McCaulley, 1985). The \nbase population for comparison must be carefully selected. \nBut the results can provide perspective on how subjects in \nthe group of concern (ADD children, for example) may be \noperating in the context of influential others (the types \namong, for example, their teachers, parents, or classmates). \nIn this regard, type research, especially in education, needs \nto investigate pcrson-context interactions. When we notice \neither success or blocks in learning, these results can be \nviewed not as a direct result of type preferences themselves \nbut as a subtle interaction between the types of our subjects \nof study and the expectations of those individuals or groups \nwho influence them. \n\nBecause of this powertul interplay between nature (what \nthe personality of each student brings to learning) and nur- \nture (the influence of the learning environment), the discus- \nsion of type differences in education ultimately pertains to \nthe issue of human growth and development. Whether their \nefforts are intentional or not, teachers, counselors, and \nschool administrators are involved with the facilitation of \nnot only the academic but also the personal development of \nstudents.

Kummerow \n\nhe use of the Mycrs-Briggs Type Indicator personality \n\ninventory in carcer counseling to help people find \nmeaningful and productive work was one of Isabel B. \nMyers original motivations in the development of the \ninstrument (Saunders, 1991). Career counseling applica- \ntions were one of the first areas of applied research on type, \nand the field continues to generate a large number of \nresearch studies. \n\nThe MBTI assessment tool has been widely used in a vari- \nety of career counseling settings including private practice, \nhigh schools, community colleges and technical schools, \ncolleges and universities, and organizations. Its use in these \nsettings has been multiple and includes identifying possible \njob titles to explore, meaningful work environments, com- \npauble interests, and congruous values. Type also con- \ntributes to understanding the job search process itself \nincluding career exploration, managing change, decision- \nmaking strategies, and implementing choices. \n\nThe goal of this chapter is to illustrate aspects of using \nthe MBTI with career counseling clients. Its how-to focus \nincludes ways to apply research results from both previously \nreviewed research literature in the 1985 MBTI Manual and \nMBTI Applications (1996) and recent rescarch studies. Addi- \ntional research based on Form M of the MBTI from several \nsamples, including a national one of over 3,000 adult men \nand women, is incorporated. (For more on the national sam- \nple sce Chapter 7.) This chapter also highlights relevant \ncareer development theory and provides suggestions to \npractitioners along with case studies that illustrate the usc- \nfulness of the MBTI with carcer counseling clients. \n\n285 \n\n86 The Uses of Type \n\nAssumptions Underlying the Use \nof the MBTI in Career Counseling \n\nMany clients arrive in career counscling with the expecta- \ntion that the process will be to give me a couple of tests that \nwill tell me what | should be. They fail to realize there are \nmany factors in occupational choice and satisfaction besides \nwhat a few psychological instruments reveal. These factors \ninclude physical and mental health, interests, values, person- \nality characteristics, family circumstances, geographic loca- \ntion, job market conditions and trends, education, skills, \nabilities, cultural/ethnic/gender identification, and so forth. \nSatisfaction within an occupation includes factors such as \nthe job itself, the organizauon, pay, supervision, co-workers, \nand advancemenvlearning opportunities. To expect the \nMBTI instrument or any other instrument to provide all of \nthe answers to a career search is improbable and unrealistic. \nIt can be only part of the puzzle in finding oncs lifes work. \n\nThe Changing Nature of \nCareer Counseling Theories \n\nImplicit also in the clients plea for *the answer\" is the \nexpectation that carecr counseling is a matter of matching a \nperson with a job. It is based on the theorctical framework \ncalled trait-and-factor espoused by Parsons in the early \n1900s, which has been the foundation of career counseling \nfor decades (Krumboltz, 1996). If using psychological type \nwithin this framework, we would work to match peoples \ntypes to careers most conducive to that type. However, \nthere are problems inherent in this approach regarding the \nuse of type: People with different types can do the same jobs \n(perhaps using different approaches), and if everyone were",

Further- \nmorc, work environments may differ widely, and thus dif- \nferent types, while doing the same jobs, may be in vastly \ndifferent workplaces. \n\nAnother theoretical framework for career counscling has \nbeen called the person x environment fit theory, which \ncspouscs that individuals can take active roles in altering or \ncreating work environments to better fit with their personal \npreferences (Chartrand, 1991). Thus self-knowledge of \ntype can help one identify what is likely to be satisfying and \nsuggest strategies for changing a work environment to be \nmore conducive to the use of one's own type. It is within \nthis framework that much of this chapter is positioned. \n\nThere are a number of other theories in the career coun- \nscling field that are included in relevant sections below. \nEach theory focuses on different aspects of the career coun- \nseling process, such as incorporating values, self-efficacy, \nand interests into the process, and all have much to con- \ntribute as a result. Folding psychological type in with these \ntheories helps expand their applicability as well. \n\nThe Changing Nature of VVork \n\nIn addition to the changing views of the theoretical nature \nof career counseling, the nature of work and career is \nchanging, and hence the essence of career counseling must \nchange also. Arthur and Rousseau (1996) define and rede- \nfine the term career as follows: *Old Meaning: a course of \nprolessional advancement; usage restricted to occupations \nwith formal hierarchical progression, such as managers and \nprofessionals. New Meaning: the unfolding sequence of any \npersons work experiences over timc\" (pp. 29-30). The old \nmeaning focuses more on what you do, i.c., the job titles \nvou hold, while the new meaning focuses more on who you \nare and the skills you bring with you from work experience \nto work experience. Bridges (1994) discusses the impor- \ntance of identifying and understanding your temperament \nas one key to prospering in the new world of work. Person- \nalities do carry \"implications for the particular roles or situ- \nations where the person is likely to work well and be \nhappy\" (p. 88). He reminds us too that cven within particu- \nlar fields, different personalities can thrive. \n\nType is particularly helpful within this new framework \nof work since its focus is a broad one on the individual. \nType also assumes a developmental component so that indi- \nviduals can adapt to new situations using all parts of their \npersonalities. Counselors can use type to help identify the \nmorc satisfying situations and roles, as well as to help indi- \nviduals adapt to those that seem to bc a stretch for them. \n\nThe Changing Role of the Career Counselor \n\nGiven that the world of work and the view of whats \nneeded in career counseling are changing, it only makes \nsense that the role of the carcer counsclor is changing as \nwell. As Krumboltz (1996) explains, \n\nMatching an individual to an occupation requires that the occu- \npation have a common and stable set of duties and expectations. \nAt one time, this requirement was quite reasonable. . .. The \nmodern age is changing the old order. Workers are increasingly \nbeing expected to accomplish whatever work needs to be \naccomplished, not merely to fulfill a written job description. . . . \nCareer counselors will have an opportunity to play a major role \nin helping individuals learn how to cope with the need for new \nskills and the associated stresses. . . . If career counselors see \ntheir job as merely matching individuals to existing occupations, \nthey will rapidly become obsolete hecause stable occupations as \nwe have known them are on the way out. (pp. 5758) \n\nWork Environments \n\nIn examining the relationship between psychological type \nand work, the focus on the larger picture of the work envi- \nronment, including tasks engaged in or avoided and the \nspecific structure of the work environment, seems appro- \npriate. Type preferences are likely to affect activities as well \nas environments that people find cnergizing and satisfying. \n\nTable 12.1 \n\nEffects of Extraversion- \n\nIntroversion in Work Situations \n\nExtraverts \n\nIntroverts \n\nLike variety and action \n\nTend to be faster, dislike \ncomplicated procedures \n(especially ES types) \n\nAre often good at greeting \npeople (especially EF types) \nAre often impatient with \nlong, slow jobs done alone \n\nAre interested in the activities \nof their job, in getting it done, \nand in how other people do it \nOften do not mind the \n\ninterruption of answering the \ntelephone (especially EF types) \n\nOften act quickly, sometimes \nwithout thinking it through \n\nLike to have people around \n(especially EF types) \nUsually communicate freely \n(especially EF types) \n\nLike quiet for concentration \n\nTend to be careful with details, \ndislike sweeping statements \n(especially IS types) \n\nHave trouble remembering names",

The work setting pref- \nerences of phvsicians were reported by Quenk and Albert \n(1975). Among the findings, Extraverted physicians favored \nactive involvement with the outside world including their \npatients and their communities. Feeling types emphasized \ninvolvement with the people in their lives and practices. \nThinking types seemed to concentrate more on the nonpeo- \nple aspects of their work such as their continued advance- \nment. Judging types desired to maintain the boundaries in \ntheir practices between personal and professional lives. \n\nResearch from data using Form M and the Work Environ- \nment Scale is reported in Chapter 9, Validity. These data \nprovide information on what is important in an ideal work \nenvironment (see Table 12.5). The sample consisted of 98 \ncmployees in a variety of occupations at a large Midwestern \nuniversity who attended a session to learn more about \nthemselves. *Co-worker cohesion\" (friendly, supportive co- \nworkers) is important in the ideal to Extraverted and Feel- \ning types; this outside focus toward others fits with the \n\nAre not often inspired and \nrarely trust the inspiration \nwhen they are \n\nFollow their inspirations, good \nor bad, regardless of the data \n(especially with inadequate type \ndevelopment) \n\nSeldom make factual errors Frequently make errors of fact, \n\npreferring instead the big picture \n\nDislike taking time for precision \n(especially EN types) \n\nTend to be good at precise work \n(especially IS types) \n\nCreate something new by \nadapting something that exists \n\nCreate something new through \na personal insight \n\ntheoretical view of Extraversion and Feeling.

This support is less important \nin the ideal work environment for the STs than for the other \nthree function pairings; again, STs may focus less on \nthe people side of how the job is accomplished.

In this study, SFs desire more clarity in terms of \ndaily work expectations than STs and NTs; this fits with the \nSF focus on detail and knowing the parameters of their work \nexpectations, along with their desire to fit in with those with \nwhom they work, perhaps hy \"pleasing\" them through doing \nthe work in a way others have delineated. Managerial con- \ntrol, or using rules to keep people under control, is in the \nexpected directions. Sensing types, more than Intuitive \ntypes, would likely want the rules spelled out ahead of time. \nJudging types, with thcir desire for structure, would likely \ndesire this more than Perceiving types. \"Innovation\" is \nimportant to Intuitive types, and especially to NFs; change \nand possibilities are often expressed in Intuition. Pleasant \nphysical surroundings are more important in the ideal to EPs \nthan to IJs; EPs extravert their dominant Perceiving func- \ntions and might be more tuned to the external environment \nthan IJs, who introvert their dominant Perceiving functions. \nMost of these findings fit with what we would expect from \ntype theory and add to our understanding of what makes an \nideal work environment for different types. \n\nDepending on what is important to individuals, satislac- \ntion with the work environment may take on different \ncasts.

The Ex- \ntraverts also liked teamwork relatively more than the \nIntroverts, something we might expect from the theory. \n\nImplications for Practitioners \n\nType theory and researeh suggest that type preferences ean \naffect the preferred work environment but also that there \nare factors that are less type related and that most types \nhave in common. For some clients, especially Sensing ones \nwho like to build on experienees, reviewing their past jobs \nfor understanding what has felt comfortable or uneomfort- \nable in previous work environments may be a helpful \nbeginning point. For other clients, especially Intuitive \ntypes, a focus on future possibilities in work environments \nmay be a more interesting start. As clients learn about type, \nthey can use Tables 12.112.4 as a focus for the possible \nenvironments and work tasks to fit either scenario. Most \nclients will note that they participate in activities on both \nsides of the dichotomies. This process helps to illustrate the \ncomplexity of type within an individual and also how peo- \nple often do use both sides. \n\nTables 12.7-12.8 also emphasize important work envi- \nronment characteristics for each type based on research \nresults and can serve as resources. Counselors may wish to \nfocus discussions on what seems to be important in the work \nenvironment to each type. Other well-known sources of \ninformation to clients that cover work setting information \ninclude Introduction to Type (Myers, with Kirby and Myers, \n1998), Introduction to Type and Carcers (Hammer, 1993), and \nIntroduction to Type in Organizations (Hirsh &amp; Kummerow, \n1998). The latter publication and LIFETypes (Hirsh &amp; Kum- \nimcrow, 1989) also suggest a preferred work environment \nlor each of the 16 types. Clients may find useful the descrip- \nons in Do What You Arc (Tieger &amp; Barron-Tieger, 1992) on \nhow work fits different types and the suggestions for adapt- \ning work tasks to type in WORK Types (Kummerow, Barger, \n&amp; Kirby, 1997). Work, Play, and Type (Provost, 1990) offers \nsuggestions lor finding play at work for different types, activ- \nities that may help bring work environments more in line \nwith type preferences. \n\nCounselors can stay alert to the work environment fae- \ntors that seem to be causing strain in the clients work life. A \nclient may be in an environment that does not fit with his or \nher natural preferences, yet for a variety of reasons prefers \nnot to change environments/jobs. Perhaps the client has \n\ninvested a great deal in getting educated/trained in the field, \nor perhaps he or she is unable to risk a potential loss of \nincome by striking out into a different environment. Ham- \nmer (1993) suggests clients might either alter the job to fit \ntheir personalities or adapt themsclves to fit the job. Clients \nmay end up doing a bit of both. One of his suggestions is \nthat clients locate or ereate within the same occupation a \nparticular environment that is more like them or find col- \nleagues with whom they share more similarities. Here are \nsome examples ol people who used this strategy: \n\nB An INFE] chemist in a research and development depart- \nment began working as a liaison between human resources \nand the scientists to help them better understand one \nanother. He found much in common with those in human \nresources and was able to increase his job satisfaction. \n\nB An ENFJ computer programmer helped found a support \ngroup for programmers at the bank in which he worked. \nEventually he moved into training people to work with \ncomputer information systems. He found like-minded \ncolleagues, which helped increase his job satisfaction, and \nthen a set of job responsibilities more compatible for his \npersonality. \n\nB An INTJ high school English teacher always took a quick \nwalk by himself at lunchtime and deliberately did not car- \npool so that he would have quiet, solitary time on the \ndrive home. This slight change of work environment \nincreased his energy and thus his job satisfaction. \n\nB An ESF) project coordinator found that working among \nhighly technical people was draining her energy and lead- \ning to much job dissatisfaction. She wanted more social \ninteraction during her day and more overt signs of appre- \nciation. She kept the same position but transferred her \ndesk into the sales and marketing department. Her col- \nleagues there socialize with her regularly, ask about her \nfamily, and often compliment her work. She has decided \nto stay in the job as a result. \n\nm One ESTP created her own testing and assessment niche \nin a firm of industrial psychologists. As a consultant on a \npart-time contract, she also had the flexibility to decide \nher own schedule, which she found immensely satisfying. \nShe was particularly strong at working with executives \nwho were in a crisis situation in terms of their perfor- \nmance. Her practical, expedient suggestions were just \nwhat was needed.",

She continually re- \narranges her office to make things more convenient; SPs \nolten seek an \"economy of effort.\" Her manager gives her \ncomplete freedom to set her own priorities, deadlines, and \nwork methods, so when she gets bored with one task, she \ncan immediately jump to another. In her personal life she \nis a hospice volunteer. When her own mother needed \n\nsuch care, she found hospice workers were like guardian \nangels who flew in when we didnt have a clue. She \nwants to be able to do the same for others now. \n\nType provides valuable insights into work environment \nissues. Counselors and clients can use that information to \nunderstand the work environment fit and/or misfit, design \nways of working within the environment or changing it, or \nenvision a different environment with the goal ultimately to \nincrease job satisfaction. \n\nOccupational Selection \n\nOne ol the most common and difficult-to-answer questions \ncareer counselors face from clients is, What job should I be \nin?\" The question is difficult in part because it is so nar- \nrowly focused. Career counscling emphasizes widening the \nfocus beyond a single job to job clusters and transferahle \nskills, and building skills to find new \"jobs\" in the future. \nThe U.S. Department of Labor is moving from a task-based \napproach with its Dictionary of Occupational Titles to an \nOccupational Information Network system to identify skill \nsets and worker attributes and to encourage people to \ndevelop multiple skills (Minnesota Department of Eco- \nnomic Security, 1997). Thus in career counseling the single \nfocus on locating one specific job is too limiting, yet it is \nalso important beeause it is the perceived need of many of \nour clients. The process of career counseling includes \nbroadening the focus and teaching clients how to use career \ndevelopment tools in the future. \n\nEven with the concerns discussed above, type remains \nuseful in foeusing on both specific jobs and job clusters and \npotential skill sets. According to type theory, MBTI types \nwould be distributed in occupations consistent with the \ncharacteristics of the work environments of those occupa- \ntions. Occupations may both require and reward specific \nways of perceiving information and making decisions on \nthat information; thus different types would be expected to \nbe attracted to different occupations. \n\nOccupational Trends by Type \n\nThe focus of this section is on the occupational trends for \nthe eight preferences and the 16 types. Myers and MeCaul- \nley (1985, p. 78) note these activities preferred by the eight \npreferences: \n\nB Extraverted types: Work that allows interaction with a \nsuccession of people or that has activities outside the \noffice or away from the desk \n\nB Introvertcd types: Work that permits some solitude and \ntime for concentration \n\nB Sensing types: Work that requires attention to details and \ncareful observation (such as in applied occupations) \n\nUses of Type in Career Counseling 205 \n\nm Intuitive types: Work that provides a succession of new \nproblems to be solved (such as in theorctical occupations) \n\nm Thinking types: Work that requires logical order, espe- \ncially with ideas, numbers, or physical objects (such as \nin occupations with technical/scientific components) \n\nm Fceling types: Work that provides service to people and a \nharmonious and appreciative work environment (such \nas in occupations emphasizing communications and \ninterpersonal aspects) \n\nB Judging types: Work that imposes a need for system and \norder \n\nB Perceiving types: Work that requires adapting to changing \nsituations or where understanding situations is more \nimportant than managing them \n\nOccupational trends by type are presented in Table 12.9. \nThe patterns appear more pronounced by the function pairs, \nor columns of the type table, rather than other combina- \ntions; the next section gives further evidence in this regard. \n\nThe Importance of the \nFunctions in Job Choice \n\nData seem to support the trend that the function pairs, ST, \nSE NE and NT, i.e., the columns of the type table, have the \nmost impact on job selection. Hammer and Maedaid \n(1992a) examined lists of occupational titles for each type \nand determined the amount of overlap on the occupational \nlists within pairs of opposite types (see Table 12.10). The \noverlap ranged from 2% to 14% with the median overlap of \n496. That is, for each pair of opposites only one to seven job \ntides out of more than 200 occupations appeared among \nthe top 50 occupations for both types. When Hammer and \nMacdaid compared pairs of types with the same functions \n(e.g., ST, SE NE NT) but different attitudes (J, IP, ER EJ). \nthey found a median overlap of 41%; for those with oppo-",

Macdaid \n(personal communication) reported another possible \nbiasing factor: When occupations wcre just opening up \nto women (as was occurring during that time period), \nthe female pioneers tended to have EN preferences. \nType theory would suggest that ENs would be more \nlikely to move to these new areas with their \"let's change \nit view of life. \n\nB What is the gender makeup of the samples? Most of the \noccupational samples combine genders. Preliminary \nresearch (Macdaid, personal communication) indicates \nthat men and women report similar type distributions in \nthe same occupation if that occupation has been open \nto both men and women. The slight exceptions secm to be \non the ThinkingFeeling dichotomy, where more women \nreport Feeling and more men Thinking, although the \noccupational distributions still lean toward the majority \ngender in the field. For example, in engincering, the \nmajority of men and women prefer Thinking; however, \nthere are more men than women who prefer Thinking in \nengineering. \n\nB What are the cducational levels represented in the occu- \npations? This particularly affects the available lists of \noccupations lor Sensing types, especially the Sensing \nPerceiving combinations. Those Sensing types with uni- \nversity degrees may notice many occupations shown as \nmost attractive to their type that do not require their \nlevel of education; this is likely to be disheartening to \nsome, and the practitioner is urged to put these data into \na context. Atsome point in the future it would be helptul \nto have occupational lists for cach type further divided \nby educational levels, such as the occupations most fre- \nquently chosen by each type with university degrees, \n\n296 The Uses of Type \n\nW How satisfted are those types with their careers? On the \nMBTI answer sheet is a question about job satisfaction. \nIn a study by McCaulley, Macdaid, and Granade (1993), \nol the 6626 who answered the question about how much \nthey liked their career, only 2% indicated they did not. \nThus the majority of those in the occupational samples \nused in the 1985 MBTI Manual and in the MBTI Career \nReport liked their jobs O.K. or a lot,\" and we assume \nthey are generally satished. A later section in this chapter \nexamines the occupational satisfaetion issue in more \ndetail. \n\nB How successful are those types in their career? We \nhave little data to that effect. See Chapter 13 for more \nbackground. \n\nTo give the reader a sample of what one encounters in \nstudies on careers and type, a synopsis of data on occupa- \ntional samples from some recent journal articles, confer- \nence proceedings, and dissertations is reported in Table \n12.12. As can be observed, the type preferenees and modal \ntypes are what one would likely expect in these various \noccupational samples.",

    "content": "Hammer (1996a) summarizes the evidence in the *occu- \npational selection\" area: \n\nEvidence to support the proposition that occupational choice is \n\nrelated to the preferences measured by the MBTI is abundant \n\nand compelling. The preponderance of data and the contingency \ntable analyses conducted on them show that the distribution of \ntypes across occupations generally follows theoretical predic- \ntions. Unequal distribution of types consistent with predictions \nhas also been found across groups within an occupation, across \ntasks within an organization, and across occupations in a differ- \nent culture using a translation of the MBTI. (p. 37) \n\nUnderstanding the Numbers in Career Data \n\nIn examining the trends in the career data, it is necessary to \nunderstand the two kinds of numbers we encounter in the \nheld and the ways those numbers are used: \n\n1. Absolute frequencies. These are often presented as per- \ncentages and are most useful when reviewing overall \nlabor force trends and attempting to understand the \nbasic characteristics of an occupation. \n\n2. Self-selection ratios (SSR). Self-seleetion ratios or con- \ntingency table analyses take into account the relative \nIrequencies of the type in the population as well as in \nthe sample gathered. They are important because type \ndistributions show that each of the 16 types does not \ncontain exactly 6.25% (or a I6th) of the population \nor of the sample. Thus a ratio, comparing the pereent- \nage of each type within a sample group to the percent- \nage existing in the base population, is important \nbecause this analysis does take the actual population \ndifferences into account. These ratios are meaningful \nwhen working with individuals to determine whether \nthe field is relatively more or less attractive to a given \n\ntype. Ratios above 1.00 mean that more people of that \ntype are attracted to the occupation than we would \nexpect given their frequency in the base population. \nNumbers less than 1.00 mean fewer of that type are \nattracted to the occupation given their frequency in \nthe population. And of course, numbers around 1.00 \nmean nearly equal frequencies in both the base popu- \nlation and the sample group. \n\nFor example, the national sample (a base population) \ncontains more ESTJs (8.7%) than INFPs (4.496). Yet if we \nwere looking at an occupational sample in which ESTJs and \nINFPs have similar percentages, such as librarians \n(Scherdin, 1994), where 7.396 are INFP and 6.1% are EST], \nwe mask these differences. It looks like ESTJs and INFPs \nfind library work equally attractive, at least from these \nnumbers. However, if we compare their frequencies in the \nsample to the base population frequencies, the INFPs have \nan SSR = 1.66 and the ESTJs, SSR = .70. Thus the oeeupa- \ntion of librarian is more attractive to the INFPs than to the \nESTJs. (See Chapter 9, Validity, lor an in-depth discussion \nof these ratios.) \n\nSample Question Illustrating SSRs \n\nTo further illustrate these concepts, we will explore possible \ncarecr and educational paths in a business environment. \nFirst we start with the national representative sample (the \noverall sample as well as males and females) as our base \npopulation, which is shown in Table 12.13. (Remember the \nnational representative sample was drawn from the national \nsample to match U.S. census data; see Chapter 7 for more \ninformation.) \n\nl. Which types are attracted to business school? \nCommon sense as well as research suggests \"that \nmanagers of all types learn to value managerial cul- \nture, which ean be characterized in type terms as \nSTJ practical and results-oriented (Walek, 1996, p. \n70). One group valuing this managerial culture is \nlikely to be those pursuing a masters of business \nadministration (MBA). A sample of MBA students, \nmost of whom have work experience (Power &amp; \nLundsten, 1997), shows the modal types to be EST] \nand IST], a match with the prediction. Table 12.14 \npresents the type distribution of this sample of over \n1,900 students and compares it with that of the base \npopulation, the national representative sample. We \ncan see that this sample of MBA students does draw \nmore STJ types as evidenced both by the frequencies \nand the ratio above 1. The NTJs, although not as great \nin numbers and frequencies as the STJs in the sample, \nhave even higher SSRs than the STJs. (Both sets of \ndata are statistically significant.) Thus even more NTs \nare attracted to the graduate program than STs, given \n\nTable 12.12 Occupational Sample Studies \n\nOccupation \n\nCertified public \naccountants \n\nDentists and dental \nspecialists \n\nFast-growth entre- \npreneurs; small firm \nentrepreneurs; small \nbusiness owners; \nlower-level managers; \nmanagers; executives \n\nHigh school basket- \nball officials \n\nHospital nurse man- \nagers and staff nurses \n\nLife insurance agents \n\nLine and staff \nmanagers \n\nSenior student affairs \nofficials on campuses \n\nSource \n\nSatava, 1996, |997 \n\nGrandy, Westerman, \nOcando, &amp; Erskine, \n1996",

Which types are drawn toward small business \n\nownership? \n\nA dream for some people is to own their own small \nbusiness. One way to look at the attraction of a partic- \nular type to small business ownership Is to compare a \nsample of small business owners to the national rep- \nresentative sample. In this case we'll use separate data \nlor men (Table 12.15) and women (Table 12.16). The \nmale and female distributions and SSRs are similar. \nIST] and EST] are the modal types for both samples, \nand both have SSRs above 1.00 (with statistical signif- \nicance at the .001 level), indicating that more of those \ntypes are attracted to small business ownership than \n\nwe might expect given the base population. However, \nin both samples, while the INTJs and ENTJs are \nsmaller in numbers, their SSRs are usually higher \nthan those for the STJs, especially in the female sam- \nple. Thus even more NTJs are attracted to small busi- \nness ownership than we might expect given their \nnumbers in the base population. (Note, however, that \nthe male INTJ sample did not reveal statistically sig- \nnificant results and thus needs to be viewed with cau- \ntion.) \n\n.

SSRs are likely to be \nhelpful with individual cases pondering directions toward \nwhich to move. The percentages of types are helpful in \nunderstanding some basic characteristics of the occupation \nor in this case also a particular educational program. \n\nType Diversity Within an Occupation \n\nAt times, while looking at the type trends in an occupation, \none can forget the diversity of specialties within an occupa- \ntion as well as the many different ways people can go about \ncompleting tasks even in more narrowly defined jobs. There \nare niches and specialties within many occupations. The \ndiversity is likely necessary within an occupation to keep \nthe occupation from growing stale and to prevent group \nthink. When someone has a type different from that of the \n\nmajority, that individual may even take the role of a pio- \nneer by bringing in fresh, new approaches and insights. \n\nMyers (1980/1995) offered data on the specialties of \nphysicians and found that types were likely to specialize in \nmedical fields predicted by type theory. In follow-up work \nby McCaulley (1977) it was noted that when physicians \nchanged specialties, they more likely went into specialties \naligned with their personality preferences. This is presented \nalso as evidence that it is the personality that shapes the \noccupational path, not the occupational path that shapes the \npersonality. For example, pediatricians did not become \nESF]s after entering that specialty, but rather it was their \nESFJ preferences that drew them to pediatrics. In other \nwords, according to these data and to type theory, those in \nthe same occupation do not develop a particular personality \nas a result of their work. The occupation does not eause the \npersonality; rather, personality characteristics may draw \npeople toward certain occupations. Thus, people in the \nsame occupation are likely to share some similar personal- \nity characteristics. \n\nThe familiar occupation of librarian provides another \nexample of type diversity within an occupation. Stereotypes \nof librarians suggest they are by preference Introverted, \nSensing or Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging. \n\nB Introverted: Concentrate quietly on ideas and information \nB Sensing: Look at facts \n\nB intuitive: Focus on ideas in new ways \n\nB Thinking: Analyze information objectively \n\nB Judging: Follow an organized system to find materials \n\nAnd, indeed, the individual preferences of I, N, T, and J \nare in the majority (Seherdin, 1994). Moving to a whole \ntype analysis, the modal type of librarians is ISTJ. Table \n12.18 provides a type table of 1,600 librarians who com- \npleted the MBTI in 1992. While the percentages between \nmen and women were generally similar on E-I, S-N, and \nJ-P, there were greater differences on T-E with men 69% T \nand women 58% T. This illustrates Macdaids (personal \ncommunication) point that even when the majority preter- \nence is toward Thinking, women will be less so in their per- \ncentages than men because more women are Feeling types \nin general. \n\nSo what happens when people of different personality \ntypes do library work? How might they go about their \nwork? Table 12.19 shows a summary by type of some spe- \ncialties within the library profession and aspects of the job \nparticularly enjoved by the representative type. This infor- \nmation is anecdotal and provided by librarians interviewed \nfor this chapter. \n\nEach of these 16 individuals works in the same oecupa- \ntion, and each has taken time to be on the desk\" and \nanswer reference questions. They nonetheless have all \nfound areas in which to specialize, aud they view some \nparts of their jobs as more satisfying than others. \n\nUses of Type in Career Counseling  301 \n\nTable 12.18 Type Table of Librarians \n\nISTJ ISF) INF] INT) \nN = 265 N = 129 N = 104 N = 184 \n16.5% 8.1% 6.5% 11.5%",

Practi- \ntioners can point out both patterns as clients assess jobs for \nthemselves. The function pairs (ST, SE, NT, NF) play the \ngreatest role in occupational choice; therefore, helping \nclients see how they can access their functions in a job is \nimportant. \n\nCareer counselors are also urged to encourage their \nclients to examine potential careers for the possibility of \nsubspecialties or at least ways of changing the mix of activi- \ntics performed: How ean the job and the personality mesh \nmore closely? An example of how clients with different \ntypes might find or create special niches within a specific \noccupation where the likelihood of using their type preter- \nences is higher is seen in Table 12.19 with librarians. \n\nFrom the data available, practitioners can see patterns \nand trends in occupational selection by type. However, they \nshould also keep in mind the bigger picture and avoid \nencouraging clients to go into a career simply because thev \nare the \"right\" type or discouraging clients from going into \na career simply because they are the wrong type. \n\n302 \n\nThe Uses of Type \n\nTable 12.19 Sample Specialties Within the Library Profession and Aspects of the Job Enjoyed \n\nIST) Cataloguer \n(public library) \n\n| \n| Deciding exact subject heading \nand classification of new works \n\n| Orderliness of the position \n\n.

The individual and \nthe environment correspond. We would predict that when \nthere is congruency between the individuals psychological \ntype and the task demands of the occupation, more satisfac- \ntion is likely to result. Myers and McCaulley (1985) state, \n\nWhen there is a mismatch between type and occupation, the \nclient usually reports feeling tired and inadequate. According to \ntype theory, the mismatch causes fatigue because it is more tir- \ning to use less-preferred processes. A mismatch also causes dis- \ncouragement, because despite the greater expenditure of effort, \nthe work product is less likely to show the quality of products \nthat would be developed if the preferred process were utilized. \nTasks that call on preferred and developed processes require less \neffort for better performance, and give more satisfaction. (p. 78) \n\nHammer (1996a) provides a summary of the studies of \njob satisfaction reported in the Career Report Manual (Ham- \nmer &amp; Macdaid, 1992a) as well as a synopsis of more than a \ndozen studies on the subject. Among the occupations stud- \nied for satisfaction data were bank officers/financial man- \nagers, computer professionals, dietitians, elementary and \nsecondary school teachers, intensive care nurses, health care \nmanagers and executives, lawyers, managers, occupational \ntherapists, parish pastors, pediatric nurse practitioners, \npharmacists, secondary marketing education teachers, secre- \ntaries, teachers, and vocational education administrators. \nHammer also points out some of the difficulties in looking at \nsatisfaction, such as a restriction in range of data on satisfac- \ntion and on unusual classifications of some of the occupa- \ntional data. He summarizes his literature review as follows: \n\nWhen satisfaction is measured globally, its relationship with \npsychological type is equivocal. However, among those studies \nthat do show a relationship, a pattern seems to emerge. Overall, \nIntroverts and Percciving types seem less satisfied with their \nwork than do Extraverts and Judging types, although the one \nstudy that examined men and women separately suggested that \noverall results may be misleading if gender is not accounted for. \nWhen specific facets or aspects of job satisfaction are employed",

Type theory would predict that dil- \nferent types will have different criteria for satisfaction, and this \nseems to be at least partially supported by the research \n\nStudies of person-environment fit . . . suggest that those \nwho are dissatisfied in an occupation tend to be those types \nwho are opposite from the modal type in the occupation. A \nnumber of studies have also suggested that those types who are \n\nUses ol Type in Carcer Counseling 303 \n\nless frequent or underrepresented in an occupation tend to be \nless satished or have higher intention to leave the occupation \nthan do those types who are more frequent or whose fit with \nthe occupation is judged to be better. (pp. 40-41) \n\nA few additional studies support Hammers 1996 sum- \nmary. Murry and Markham (1997) noted that in their sam- \nple of employees of a media organization, the INFPs indi- \ncated high dissatisfaction and likelihood to leave. Their \ncolleagues with opposite types, ESTJs, indicated high satis- \nfaction and little likelihood to leave. Hammer noted this IP \ndissatisfaction and EJ satisfaction pattern also. \n\nHopkins (1997) surveyed 133 members of a professional \nassociation on type and concluded that people who felt \ntheir job matched their personalities were more satisfied \nwith their jobs than those who did not. SFs were the group \nleast satisfied with their job matches. In personal telephone \ncalls with some subjects, Hopkins (personal communica- \ntion) noted also that SFs, out of the four function pairs, \nseemed the most grateful that someone was listening to \nthem and their concerns. In his study, the variables of co- \nworkers, the work itself, and supervision were far more \nimportant to job satisfaction than werc pay and promo- \ntions. His sample was highly educated, high in job tenure, \nmiddle-aged, and Caucasian. \n\nTischler (1996) examined the success of a group of gov- \nernment employees based on their personality fit with their \norganization. Performing satisfactorily, i.e. success, is often a \nvariable related to satisfaction. He commented that while \npeople may have been drawn to careers and organizations by \ntheir personality fits and may remain there and draw comfort \nand satisfaction partly because of those fits, their success as \nmeasured by salary increase and promotions was not signifi- \ncantly related to type. Age, gender, and education were the \nvariables in his sample that did affect success. Thus person- \nality type was not a key factor of success in his sample. \n\nJob Satisfiers and Dissatisfiers \nin the National Sample \n\nAlthough there may be many reasons for persons to seek \ncareer counseling, one is likely to be dissatisfaction with the \ncurrent job. 1n the national sample, data on work satisfac- \ntion and dissatisfaction were gathered. Respondents were \nasked to indicate their responses on a four-point scale of \nVery Satisfied, Somewhat Satisfied, Somewhat Dissat- \nisfied, or Very Dissatisfied on 3 questions related to their \noverall work (the work, company, and future work oppor- \ntunities) and 14 questions on aspects of their work. They \nwere also asked to indicate how likely they were to leave \ntheir current job within the next year on a scale of Very \nLikely\" Somewhat Likely\" or Very Unlikely. Income \ndata were gathered as well. Table 12.20 presents this infor- \nmation for the highest and lowest of the types on the vari- \nahles related to the overall work satisfaction picture. \n\nThe vast majority of people in this sample, over 89%, \nwere at least somewhat satisfied with the kind of work they \n\n304 The Uses of Type \n\nTable 12.20 The Types Expressing the Most and Least Work Satisfaction and Likelihood \nto Leave, and the Highest and Lowest Income Levels in the National Sample \n\nIST} INT) \n\nLess satisfied with future \nopportunities \n\nISFP \n\nISTP INFP INTP \n\nLow income Less satisfied with work Less satisfied with work \n\nLess satisfied with company \n\nUnlikely to leave Less satisfied with company Less satisfied with company \n\nLess satisfied with future \nopportunities \n\nLess satisfied with future \nopportunities \n\nLikely to leave Likely to leave \n\nESER \n\nESTP \n\nLess satisfied with company Likely to leave \n\nEST] ESF] \n\nSatisfied with work Satisfied with work \n\nSatisfied with company Satisfied with company \n\nUnlikely to leave \n\nSatisfied with work \nSatisfied with company \nLess satisfied with work \n\nLikely to leave \n\nENTP \n\nLess satisfied with work \n\nENF] ENT] \n\nSatisfied with work \n\nSatisfied with company \nSatisfied with future opportunities \n\nHigh income \n\nUnlikely to leave \n\nNote: All sixteen types were ranked from high to low on each variable.

In reviewing the literature on type and \nturnover, the focus has been on job fit/misht and job dissat- \nisfaction. Hammer (19962) reviews research from the 1985 \nMBTI Manual and other studies and concludes, \n\nAlthough few studies have heen conducted on turnover, those \nthat are available provide some support for the proposition that \ntypes working in environments or jobs that are not a good \nmatch for their preferences are more likely to leave or to say \nthey are going to leave than are those whose type provides a \nbetter fit for either the tasks or the environment. Future studies \nexamining the relationship of type and turnover should heed \nGardens (1989) finding that organizational size may be a \nmediating variable. One study has suggested that the type ol the \nmanagers in an organization may also be related to employee \nturnover.

For ENTPs \nwho are also dissatisfied with their salaries but are among \nthe highest paid of the 16 types, the issue and its solution \nmay be something different. \n\nBecause the nature of work and the stability of jobs are \nchanging, it is noteworthy that the areas of biggest concern \ninclude some that are unlikely to improve. Job security and \npromotional opportunities are decreasing, while stress is \n\nlikely to increase. To help clients weather this new world of \n\nwork, career counseling can help clients focus on their \nunique talents, some of which the MBTI might help point \nout; identify methods to teach clients to cope with stress \nand increase their natural resiliency; and encourage clients \nto take responsibility for their own career development. \n\nInterests \n\nInterests are also key components in careers. Holland's \ntypology of persons and work environments is a major force \nin career psychology (Spokane, 1996) and is measured by \nassessing the interests of individuals. \"Individuals seek and \nremain in congruent environments; and environments \nrecruit, retain and reward congruent people. Congruence is \nassessed according to the degree of match between the \n\nUses of Type in Career Counseling 307 \n\nvocational personality of an individual and the environ- \nmental type of an occupation or position\" (Gottfredson &amp; \nHolland, 1996, p. 6). Thus, liking the activities associated \nwith ones job and with the people doing the job leads to job \nsatisfaction and tenure. \n\nThe tenets of Holland's theory of vocational interests \ninclude the idea that both people and environments can be \nclassified into six types: Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, \nSocial, Enterprising, and Conventional (RIASEC); these are \noften displayed on a hexagon. Figure 12.1 delineates the \nhexagon and gives brief dehnitions of each vocational \ntheme. The interests that are most closely related are next to \none another on the hexagon, and those that are situated \nopposite each other are least related. Thus Realistic and \nInvestigative are closely related whereas Realistic and Social \nare not. Within the Holland codes, people are more likely a \ncombination of types, rather than just one; for example, a \ncounselor may have a Social-Enterprising-Artistic (SEA) \ncode. \n\nThere are a number of instruments that measure inter- \nests, and several have been correlated with the MBTI. Chap- \nter 9, \"Validity,\" provides information on several studies. \nStudies on the Strong Interest Inventory (Strong), the Kuder \nOccupational Intcrest Survey, the Opinion, Attitude, and Intci- \ncst Scales (OAIS), and the Vocational Preference Inventory \n(VPI) are included in Chapter 11 of the 1985 MBTI Manual. \nA summary and discussion of these studies and additional \nresearch also appear in Hammer and Macdaid (19923) and \nHammer (19962). The latter also includes a summary of a \nstudy correlating type with the Career Occupational Prefer- \nence System Intcrest Inventory (COPS). The most complete \ndata on the relationship of the MBTI to interests is reported \nin the Strong and MBTI Career Development Guide by Ham- \nmer and Kummerow (1992 edition for the 1985 Strong and \n1996 for the 1994 Strong). \n\nHammer and Kummerow (1996) report correlations \nranging from 0.00 to .48 between the MBTI preferences and \nthe Strong General Occupational Themes, which measure \nthe Holland themes: \n\nm Realistic is moderately correlated with Thinking; its \nOpposite, Social, is moderately correlated with Feeling as \nwell as Extraversion. \n\nm Artistic is moderately correlated with Intuition and Per- \nceiving, as well as Feeling, whereas its opposite, Con- \nventional, is moderately correlated with Sensing and \nJudging (opposite preferences on the MBTI). \n\nW Enterprising is moderately associated with Extraversion. \n\nAnalyzing the correlations between the Strong General \nOccupational Scales and type preferences, Hammer \n(1996a) noted that the J-P scale showed the lowest and \nthe fewest correlations with Strong Occupational Scales. \nOther publications (Hammer &amp; Macdaid, 1992b) suggest \n\"that this scale is the one least likely to reflect an attraction \nto a particular occupational field.

However, because the correlations are moderate at \nbest when they exist, they indicate that both instruments \n(and hence personality and interest data) have unique con- \ntributions to make to the career counseling process. \n\nInterests and Self-Efficacy \nin the National Sample \n\nSocial cognitive career theory and research (Lent, Brown, &amp; \nHackett, 1996) suggest that interests are strongly related to \nones self-efficacy (p. 400). What one believes he or she can \ndo often leads to interests in that area. People are likely to \npursue and persist in arcas where they have confidence in \ntheir abilities. To study the variables of self-efficacy or confi- \ndence, the performance of various work activities, and inter- \nests, the national sample was asked to provide self-ratings on \nthe RIASEC themes. The three questions asked were, \n\nSolving abstract \nproblems, scientific \nactivities, lab work \n\nInvestigative (I) \n\nCreating or \n\nArtistic (A) appreciating art, \nmusic, literature \nSocial (S) Helping others, \nteaching, counseling \n\n1.

The most often performed \ntasks in this group were in the Social area, which is also the \nmost liked area and where these respondents have the most \nconfidence; Conventional was next.

The function pair pattern results also fit with type the- \nory. A similar pattern emerges for the Skills Confidence \nInventory data; what one has confidence in, one tends to \nlike, and vice versa. The relationships reported were statisti- \ncally significant at least at the .05 level or better and seem to \nfit with type theory and the previous research. \n\nImplications for Practitioners \n\nInterests generally relate to type in the directions expected, \nbut the size of the relationship is usually moderate to small, \nespecially at the occupational level. Often types that are \nopposite from one another will have opposite interest pat- \nterns as well. Practitioners are urged to use interests to add \nto the power of personality type, not replace it. An Artistic \nEST] is likely quite different from an Artistic INFP. Both \nwant to be creative yet likely will do so in quite different \nmanners. For example, an Artistic EST] found work in the \n\ncompensation and benefits area quite creative, while an \nINFP Artistic used his creativity as an author and university \nprofessor. An Enterprising ENFP will lead and persuade in \na different manner than an Enterprising ISTJ. One Enter- \nprising ENFP became an attorney specializing in mediating \nconflicts between small businesses. Her Enterprising ISTJ \nhusband is an executive in a computer company. Each set of \ninformation augments the other and increases the practi- \ntioners ability to help clients. \n\nSelf-efficacy is another useful concept to explore with \nclients, and type seems to relate to what clients likely have \nconfidence in performing. It may also provide paths to \nexplore with clients. For example, do the ENTs really have \nskills in the areas in which they have confidence, or would \nsome reality checking help them? Do the ISFs really lack \nskills since they report lower self-efficacy when compared \nto other types, or do they simply need more encouragement \nlo try some activities or to even acknowledge their own \nskill levels? Self-efficacy data related to interest patterns can \nsuggest areas to focus on first, but as with any instrument \nthey need to be put in the context of the individual. \n\nKummerow and Hammer (1995) offer a workbook to help \nclients integrate results from the Strong and the MBTI and a \nguide (Hammer &amp; Kummerow, 1996) to assist practitioners \nwith that integration. Starting Out, Starting Over (Peterson, \n\n312 The Uses of Type \n\n1995) and Real People, Real Jobs (Montross, Leibowitz, and \nShinkman, 1995) also look at interests and personality. \nGrutter (19983, 1998h, 1998c) has three publications care- \nfully delineating the integration of the two instruments for \nthose wanting to enrich their work lives or make a transi- \ntion to different roles or responsibilities. \n\nValues \n\nBoth theory and research support the importance of work \nvalues in making career decisions (Brown, 1996). Options \nreflecting highly prioritized values are chosen when they \nare available. Thus career practitioners would do well to \nunderstand the values of their clients, since they likely are a \ndriving force in a career decision. \n\nHammer (19962) summarized five studies relating type",

For exam- \nple, Sensing and Judging often relate to a desire for security \nand stability, while Intuition and Percciving often relate to a \ndesire for creativity. \n\nGarden (1997) examined the career paths of 341 soft- \nware technical professionals in small high-tech companies \nfor motivation profiles and future career directions. In \nexamining the eight preference poles, she found that all val- \nued money and comfort, recognition and autonomy, sug- \ngesting that similarities within the profession, not type pref- \nerences, made the difference. However, in examining four \npossible career paths (managerial, technical, challenging \nproject, own company), she found statistically significant \ntype differences. For the larger type cells (215) she found \nthese patterns: \n\nB Managerial path was chosen most often by ESTJ, ENFJ, \nIST]. \n\nB Technical path was chosen most often by INT]. \n\nm Challenging project path was chosen least often hy INFP. \n\nB Own company path was chosen most often hy ENTP \nand INTP \n\nB ENFPs sorted themselves nearly equally among the four \npaths. \n\nIn a study of a media organization, Murry and Markham \n(1997) investigated how the collective personality of an \norganization, based on type, might shape the structure of \ntheir espoused values (based on Rokeach's work on values). \nWhile the samples in cach of the types were not large \nenough for separate analyses, for the ISTJs and ISFJs there \nwas more of an emphasis on fitting in, predictability, a sin- \ngle culture, and rule orientation. NFs had the most congru- \nence with the top values in this organization, which \nincluded an emphasis on quality, team orientation, flexibil- \nitv and fairness, security of employment, and innovation; \n\nthe authors suggest this may be because of the creative \nnature of this media organization. \n\nMitchell (I981) also studied work values in a sample of \nmore than 800 employees in a banking organization. Sce \nChapter 9 for more background information on his study. \nHe identified these eight factors as organizational values: \n\nI. Happy family: harmonious interpersonal relationships \n\nwith pleasant material surroundings \n\nVariety and challenge: latitude to work creatively on \n\nintellectually stimutating problems \n\n3. Achievement within the system: orientation toward \nclimbing the corporate ladder \n\n4. Visible autonomy: free expression of views even when \nat odds with the social milieu \n\n5.

This same value did not \nappear important to the sample of their opposites, the NTs, \nwho are more likely to value their personal autonomy. In \nfocusing on two opposite types such as ISFJ and ENTR, the \nsame values never appear on both lists. What is important \nto one is not to the other. The EP group does not scem to be \nparticularly oriented toward climbing the corporate ladder; \nthey are generally free-spirited people, open to the moment. \nClimbing a corporate ladder likely requires working within \na system and planning ones career moves in advance, a \nstyle that likely does not appeal to EPs but docs to EST]s. \n\nValues of the National Sample \n\nThe national sample was asked to indicate how important \n11 values were in their lives on a scale of \"Very Important, \n\"Somewhat Important,\" Somewhat Unimportant, or Not \nImportant.

The data can serve as reassurance to clients \nthat types may value different things, and that it is good to do \nso. An ENTP executive with multiple sclerosis was strug- \ngling with health and work issues; she couldnt seem to limit \nher work enough to reduce stress and hence control her ill- \nness better. She found it affirming to know that ENTPs do \nplace their autonomy ahead of their health. She was not act- \ning in an unusual way for her type, but in her case it was an \nunhealthy way. She would need to pay more attention to her \n\nhealth because of her individual condition, while searching \nfor ways to still maintain as much autonomy as possible. \n\nAnother ENTP quite surprised himself when he turned \ndown an outstanding job offer because it would mean relo- \ncating his high school-age son. He had been pursuing the \nvalue of achievement but realized that home/tamily was \nmost important to him. Indeed, the data confirm chat \nhome/family is the most important value to ENTPs (and to \nall types except INTPs and INTJs). The values data helped \nhim see the bigger picture. \n\n316 The Uses of Type \n\nCareer Decision Making \n\nAt the heart of career counseling is carcer decision making. \nAny decision depends on good information and rational \njudgments, and type theory is based in perception (Sensing \nand Intuition), which involves gathering data, and in judg- \nment (Thinking or Fecling), which involves making deci- \nsions. All major decisions need to involve each function: \nthe Sensing facts, the Intuitive possibilities, the objective \nanalysis of Thinking, and the values focus of Feeling. Also \nnceded are Introverted reflective time and some Extraverted \naction, as well as a time to stay open with Perceiving and a \ntime to come to a conclusion with Judging. Thus carcer \ndecision making includes not only the decision itself but \nalso what goes into the decision and its implementation. \nType concepts can help clients in all three activities. \n\n'acccara (1988) tracked a sample of 210 outplaced man- \nagers (mostly malc) and noted that on the average it took \nthe Introverted types one month longer to find a new posi- \ntion than it took the Extraverted types at cvery level of com- \npensation they studied. The Extraverted types are likely to \nhave more contacts or at least make more contacts in the \ncareer search process and thus connect more quickly with a \nnew employer. The Introverted types are likely to want to \ntake in information and ponder it, and thus move more \nslowly and carefully through the job scarch process. \n\nHammer (19962) reviews six studies relating career deci- \nsion/indecision with type. The studies, mostly of college \nstudents, provided evidence that Judging types demonstrate \nmore career decisiveness than Perceiving types. Type theory \nwould predict that Judging types would move toward \nclosure and Perceiving types would move toward gather- \ning options. The data on the other dichotomies, E-I, S-N, \nand T-E did not show consistent relationships to career \ndecisiveness. \n\nFreeman (1994) investigated the relationship between \ncareer maturity (using the Career Development Inventory) \nand type (using the MBTI) and found no statistically signifi- \ncant correlations between the two instruments. She sug- \ngested that career counselors accept different psychological \ntype preferences as effective processes for making credible \ncareer decisions. Type theory would suggest there are a vari- \nety of different strategies in making career decisions and",

She compared a group of 50 \nmidlife women to a control group ol 43 similar women. \nOverall she found that the career decision-making sell- \nefficacy of the treatment group women increased, although \nit did not reach statistical significance. \n\nKrumboltz (1992) offers another perspective on career \nindecision, focusing on the social pressure accompanying \n\nthe word indecision. He believes career indecision is treated \nalmost as a mental disorder by some professional coun- \nselors, yet learning how to make a career decision is not \nnecessarily a legitimate activity in U.S. society. He suggests, \n\"Open-mindedness can be viewed as a virtue. Kecping ones \noptions open may be far preferable to stating goals which \nmay or may not be possible of attainment and which could \nlead to frustration and unhappiness\" (p. 244). In his Career \nBeliefs Inventory (CBI) Krumboltz (199]) identifies 25 \nscales measuring career beliefs that may keep people from \nattaining their carcer goals. In a sample of adults seeking \ncareer counseling there were no significant correlations \nbetween type and the beliefs blocking career goal achieve- \nment as mcasured on the CB] (Hammer, 1996a). Thus type \nappears to be independent of behaviors blocking career goal \nachievement, at least in this research study. \n\nImplications for Practitioners \n\nSince the perceiving (S-N) and judging ( TF) functions are \nsuch an important part of career decision making, it is use- \nful 10 pay attention to how clients are using their functions. \nThe J-P dichotomy based in type dynamic theory focuses \non which function is extraverted. J-P itself, like all the \ndichotomies, contains neutral terms, with neither pole being \nbetter or worsc. However, the overuse ol either one may cir- \ncumvent the career development process. Judging types \nmay use their thinking or feeling functions to quickly make \ndecisions and perhaps not gather enough information. \nImplementing the decision may be more difficult as a result. \nThey may find it helpful to caution themselves against \nquick decisions and take the tack that my plan is to stay \nopen.\" Perceiving types may find themselves enjoying the \nsearch for options and thus avoid any decision that would \nclose off any potentially interesting option. With them a \nuseful tack may be to spend more time looking at what \ndoors remain open with each career decision rather than \nwhich doors have been shut. \n\nIntroduction to Type and Careers (Hammer, 1993) delin- \ncates a career exploration process for each of the 16 types \nincluding a preferred method for each type, potential obsta- \ncles, and tips. Levin, Krumboltz, and Krumboltz (1995) \noffer a workbook for integrating MBTI, Strong, and Carecr \nBeliefs Inventory information. Type dynamics, discussed \nlater in this chapter, also offers suggestions for counselors \nregarding career exploration including decision making. \n\nOur task in thc long run is not just to help people find \nsatisfying jobs and work environments now but also to pre- \npare them for thc many career/job searches they will be per- \nforming throughout their lives. We need to teach strategies \nfor making decisions, dealing with change, handling stress, \nand visioning, and for identifying and locating new jobs \nbased on the abilities clients possess or on the skills they \ncan learn. \n\nOther Factors Influencing \nCareer Counseling \n\n[here are any number of other factors that might influence \ncareer counseling, and some of those have been studied in \nrelationship to the MBTI. Ethnicity may be one such factor. \nIn a study of 231 African Americans, Gchringer (1994) \nfound that for five occupational groups there was a similar \ndistribution to occupational groups representative of a \nnational sample. The four occupational samples that dif- \nfered from the national sample were more heavily IST], the \nmodal type in the African American sample. \n\nJob performance also may be a factor in career develop- \nment; see Chapter 13 for a review of these issues. Addi- \ntional personality measures that often describe behaviors \non the job, such as the California Psychological Inventory \n(CPI), the Adjective Check List, and the California Q-Sort, \nhave been reported in Thorne and Gough (1991) as well as \nthe 1985 MBTI Manual. Chapter 9 and Chapter 10 of this \nmanual also contain relevant studies. \n\nFour Levels of Type Interpretation \nin Career Counseling \n\nHammer (1996a) discusses three levels of type interpreta- \nlion: static, dynamic, and developmental. A fourth level, \nbehavioral, can be added with the advent of the MBTI Step \nIl (formerly the Expanded Analysis Report). These levels, \nwith relevant applications to career counseling, are dis- \ncussed below. \n\nStatic Level \n\nThe static level is the basic and most widely used method",

People of the same \npreference, combination of preferences, or whole type share \nmany characteristics in common; individual differences are \nignored at this level. This approach is used when career \ncounselors rely solely on type descriptions to understand \nclients, when clients self-assess, and when trends in job \nselection by type are calculated with both the frequencies of \nthe particular type within a job and the frequencies com- \npared to a base population. \n\nAs John Holland (1994) says, \"In general, the strengths \nol typologies lie in their ability to organize information. In \ncontrast, the weaknesses of typologies lie in their neglect ol \nthe processes entailed in change and development\" (p. 50). \nMuch ol the information presented in this chapter is of the \n\nUses of Type in Career Counseling 317 \n\n \n\nstatic nature and has been a useful way to organize data \nabout personality and careers. It docs not take into account \nindividual uniqueness nor does it allow lor change and \ndevelopment. While the static level is well researched and \nvery uscful, nonetheless career counselors are urged also to \nincorporate the other levels and morc fully use all of type \ntheory. \n\nDynamic Level \n\nThe dynamic interpretation locuses on the interplay be- \ntween and among the preferences within the type, specifi- \ncally how inlormation is perceived and how decisions are \nmade. (See Chapter 3 for more information.) As a review, \ncach type has a dominant or lead function with an auxiliary \nfunction for balanec. If the dominant function is a perceiv- \ning one (Sensing or Intuition), the auxiliary function is a \njudging one (Thinking or Feeling) and vice versa. This \nmeans a person has access to ways of both gathering data \nand making decisions about these data. Each person also \nhas preferred ways, either Extraverted or Introverted, of \nexpressing the dominant and auxiliary functions, thus \nenabling the person access to both the internal and external \nworlds, although one arena will still be the favorite. In \nterms of type, well-developed people have good balance \nbetween Perceiving and Judging and between Extraverting \nand Introverting; they do not use them equally, but they \nhave conscious access to both sides. Thus they have a pre- \nferred means of gathering data and making decisions, as \nwell as personality mechanisms allowing thein to both \nreflect and act. Each type also has a tertiary function and a \nfourth, or least-preferred, function (also called the inferior), \nwhich tend to be less developed and less used. The pre- \nlerred order of the functions from dominant to inferior is \nthe same for everyone of the same type, but the conscious \nand appropriate use of the four functions may depend on \nthe persons type development (scc the next section). \n\nUsing the dynamic approach helps counselors ascertain \nactivities that are likely to be important and interesting to \nclients. It also helps identify how people are functioning in \nthe use of their type including looking at issues of balance \nand imbalance. Type dynamies can be used to improve \ncareer decision making. For example, dominant extraverted \nIntuitives (ENTP and ENFP) may find the continual identi- \nfication of career possibilities very appealing. However, \nwithout taking time to turn inward and evaluate these pos- \nsibilities (i.c., use their introverted judging function), they \nmay find themselves on a perpetual merry-go-round of \nactivity. Dominant introverted Intuitives (INTJ and INEJ) \nmay find themselves endlessly forming internal visions of \nwhats possible for them and may need at times to discuss \ntheir visions with others to help access their extraverted \ndecision-making functions. The necessity of accessing both \nthe dominant and auxiliary processes in the appropriate \nattitudes is important to all clients. \n\n318 The Uses of Type \n\nAnother way to illustrate the impact of type dynamics in \nworking with clients is based on work incorporating the Risk \nTaking/Adventure scale of the Strong Interest Inventory with \ntype dynamics. Kummerow and Hammer (1995) examined \nfour type combinations in relationship to risk taking: NP. NJ, \nSP. SJ. Risk taking often involves acting on ones perceptions, \nhence the preference combinations. Type dynamics, which \ninvolve the extraverting or introverting of that perceiving \nfunction, make a difference in risk-taking styles. \n\n@ NPs extravert their Intuition whether its dominant or \nauxiliary; they are out in the world seeing options and \npossibilities. These types generally are the greatest risk \ntakers (although occasionally they do not see themselves \nas such). They like finding an interesting possibility and \ntrying it. Kummerow and Hammer (1995) describe the \nNP style as likely to jump into new possibilities or \nmove into completely new directions, especially at the",

She felt she was leaping like a lunatic into all \nthese interesting possibilities. It was only when she took \ntime to look at her own priorities and needs that she \ngained focus. \n\nB The SP by contrast extraverts Sensing, scanning the \nenvironment for the most interesting piece of data and \nthen following it. SPs are likely to take immediate risks \nif the situation demands it. They prefer long-term \nsecurityhome and familiar people are important\" \n(Kummerow &amp; Hammer, 1995). SPs may also need to \nslow down and introvert to evaluate the most important \npieces of data. An ISTP sales representative continually \nchanged jobs, always seeing something better in the next \none. As he noted, his rsum looked like Swiss cheese. \nEvery other aspect ol his life (home, family) was quite \nstable. He needed help in analyzing what the next job \nwould really be like (using his introverted Thinking \nfunction), not just how it looked at the moment. In addi- \ntion, he required help identifying the long-term risks \nand the bigger picture. \n\nB NJs introvert their Intuition. They need to have an inter- \nnal vision of whats important to them before they will \nmove to action. Sometimes that vision comes easily, \nsometimes not. They find it nearly impossible to move to \naction until that vision is in place. Kummerow and Ham- \nmer (1995) describe them as willing to take long-term \nrisks for the sake of strongly held ideals.\" They prefer \n\"careful analysis and preparation for risks.\" One ENT], \nrecently divorced, said that until she had a vision of what \nwas important to herthat is, keeping her children with \n\nher as much as possible while earning maximum dol- \nlarsshe felt unable to find a job. With that vision, she \ncould move to action. She found an on-the-road sales job \nin a resort arca for the summer, where she could drive \nher children along. The calls to customers were short \nones, and her children could entertain themselves safely \nin the car. Each evening was a special time together in a \nmotel. \n\nB SJs introvert their Sensing, and they will take moderate \nrisks after long thought and preparation. They prefer \nto stick with what works and are least willing of the \ncombinations to take risks (Kummerow &amp; Hammer, \n1995), One described herself as staying parked until Pm \npushed out. SJs need time to access their memories and \nexperiences as well as to gather more information and \nponder it. They like to come up with several plans before \nproceeding, and all that takes time. One IST] was \nunhappy with his current work situation as an office \nsupervisor. He considered (plan A) transferring to \nanother branch, (plan B) finding a new employer, and \n(plan C) setting up his own office services business. \nWhile he was exploring each of these, plan A worked \nout and he is now quite happy in his new location. \n\nHammer and Kummerow (1996) present data indicating \nthat those who introvert a dominant perceiving function \n(ISFJ, ISTJ, INEJ, and INTJ) score lowest in risk taking on \nthe Strong scale. The act of taking in data (whether its in \nfactual or big picture form) seems to decrease the willing- \nness to take risks. They also noted that for one sample, the \nFJ types (all of whom extravert Feeling, whether its domi- \nnant or auxiliary) also are lower on risk taking; perhaps the \nact of harmonizing with ones external environment affects \nthe willingness to take risks. \n\nMore illustrations of the impact of type dynamics on \ncareer counseling interventions are provided by Heavrin \n(1998). She presents case studies demonstrating how the \ndominant and auxiliary can work together well in an INTP \nclient, what happens when the auxiliary is not accessed in \nan INFJ client, and what occurs with an ENFP when the \ndominant and auxiliary are both used in the same attitude \n(Extraverted) instead of opposite E-l attitudes. \n\nThrough the inclusion of type dynamics, career coun- \nselors can work with clients to round out their information- \ngathering and decision-making strategies. Practitioners can \nbe alert to when type dynamics are out of balance in their \nclients and suggest remedies so that clients can access all \nparts of their personalities. \n\nDevelopmental Level \n\nThe developmental approach to type recognizes that each \ntype has an \"ideal\" order of development over time: Early in \nlife the dominant function emerges and then the auxiliary, \nso that by the time one enters the work world, both are \naccessed and functioning together.

Table 12.29 provides a sum- \nmary of this bridging. \n\nAs an illustration of these concepts, we will examine the \ntvpe (and career) development of four EJ friends (ESTJ, \nESFJ, ENFJ, ENTJ) who all received graduate degrees in \ncounseling psychology. They are in the maintenance stage \nof their careers, although the cases will take the reader \nthrough the exploration and establishment stages as well \n(see Tables 12.30-12.33). Those types with the same func- \ntion pairs (ST, SE NE and NT) are likely to notice similar, \nalthough not identical, patterns in their work lives. It is also \ndifficult to separate the individual preferences from one \nanother, since type is a dynamic whole; for the sake of the \nillustrations this was attempted. \n\nThese four friends made initial career choices based on \ntheir dominant functions, and all have gained comfort \nusing all four functions in their work. The less-preferred \n\nfunctions act to support the dominant and auxiliary ones. \nThey each have two favorite functions they like to rely on \nthe most and with which they feel most at easc, and they \nalso enjoy using their third and fourth functions in their \nwork and in their lives. \n\nFor those working with midlife career changers, knowl- \nedge of type development concepts is particularly useful. \nNavigating Midlife (Corlett &amp; Millner, 1993) offers much \ninformation using typology as a guide to that process. Grut- \nter (1990) offers three case illustrations using type with \nclients in Supers maintenance stage of their careers. 1n one \nof her cases she tracks the career development of an ESFP \nhigh school coach and counselor. His tertiary (Thinking) \nemerged partially with his return to graduate school for a \ndegree in counseling.

While doing well \nin graduate school, she nonetheless describes the counseling portion of the training as difficult. Her Intuitive and Feeling \nfunctions were being called upon before she was comfortable using them. She did enjoy the academic counseling job she \nheld, especially when she was a coordinator of counselors, where she could use her preferred functions most. \n\nShe went into a research job upon completion of a doctorate in part because she was not geographically mobile due to \nher husband' position and in part because it fit with her training and personality. Next was a position for more than a \ndecade with a consulting firm conducting job assessments based on testing and interviews. The position was part-time, \nenabling her to spend time with her two children. Her interests led her to training other professionals about psychological \ntests and writing practical guides about those tests.

She finds the training and writing move \nher toward seeing the big picture and staying current with the theories, as well as recognizing what's really important to the \npeople with whom she works. In her individual work with clients in career counseling, she finds herself more easily tuning in \nto their emotions and values, something she would have avoided earlier in her practice.

Her next job was a logical choice also: While her husband was in \n\ngraduate school she took a job at the same university as an academic counselor. This confirmed her comfort in the academic life \n(her father was a professor), and she pursued a graduate degree in counseling. ' \n\nHer subsequent jobs also followed a logical progression from counseling to counselor supervision to training, and they \noffered her opportunities for change, challenge, and learning (often motivators for NTs).

An ENFP found the study of law \nquite fascinating and enjoyable in midlife; she couldn't \nbelieve how much fun it was to analyze a case, an activity \nshe could not have imagined herself undertaking several \nycars earlier. Thus she made a career transition from fund- \nraiser to law student in midlife. Sensing types may find \nscarching for patterns and studying theories much more \nengrossing in the second half of their lives. Intuitive types \nmay find that developing a detailed and factual base on a \ntopic of interest holds their attention later in life. Extraverts \nare often surprised as they age how much they enjoy their \nintroverted time; this would be a natural part of their \naccessing their Introverted functions. Introverts also report \nmore willingness to extravert in the second halt of life \nregarding the things that are important to them. Fitzgerald \n(1997) provides additional framing and examples of this \nprocess in managers and leaders. Creative Aging (Millner, \n1998) provides in-depth portraits of the 16 types and their \ntype development. \n\nBehavioral Level (or MBTI Step 1l) \n\nThe MBTI Step Il is a scoring method that results in not only \nthe four-letter type but 20 ways, or subseales (5 per \ndichotomy), in which that type expresses itself. Its results \nillustrate the unique expression of each type. For example, \npart of Extraversion is an enjoyment of talking and express- \ning ones views. However, it is possible to be an Introvert and \nalso to prefer talking a great deal to others (Expressive). As \nanother example, some Extraverted types prefer one-to-one \nrelationships (Intimate), not opportunities to be in large \ngroups engaging in networking aetivities (Gregarious). \n\nThis level of understanding is very helpful in the career \nsearch and decision-making process. It suggests possible \nstrategies and behaviors that are likely to come more easily \nto the client and those that are more difficult. Even for \nthose who are clear in their preferenecs, the understanding \nof the specific behaviors within those preferences is useful. \nFor example, one ISF) who preferred Receiving (1) realized \nthat to make the necessary contacts in a department she \nwas interested in transferring to she needed to use Initiating \n(E). Her Step H results helped her understand why those \ntasks were likely to be difficult but also gave her specific \nideas about how Initiaung people might go about the task. \nShe made the contacts, found her dream job, and now is \nusing another part of her personality, her Systematic (J) \nside, to keep her name in front of that department. \n\nFor others, understanding of their subscales helps them \nbetter incorporate parts of themselves that scem in opposi- \ntion. For example, decision-making behaviors on the Step \nII are represented by a combination of scores on two sub- \nscales: Logical-Empathetie (ideal decision-making strategy) \nand Reasonable-Compassionate (actual deeision-making/ \n\nimplementation strategy). An ENT] was experiencing some \nconflict in her decision making. She was Empathetie (F) in \nthe ideal but Reasonable (T) in her actual style. She would \nfind herself torn between wanting to help people by \nempathizing and agreeing with them and using her logic to \nmake a decision. Once she understood the confliet she \nstarted using the Empathetie (F) to lead her to data to \nweigh, and relied more on her preferred Thinking side for \nthe actual decision. Decisions are much easier for her now. \n\nSince the focus of this manual is on Step I, readers who \nare interested in exploring Step Il are invited to study these \nresources: Saunders (1989), Kummerow and Quenk (1992), \nQuenk and Kummerow (1996), and Mitchell, with Quenk \nand Kummerow (1997). Step II results are available only \nfrom Forms J and K of the MBTI. \n\nImplications for Practitioners \n\nEach level of type interpretation adds to both the client's \nself-understanding and the practitioners ability to help the \nclient with career counseling activities.

The MBTI Step H \npoints out the unique ways in which each type is expressed, \nwhich offer clues to accessing the behaviors inherent in \neach subscale pole. All levels ean be used interchangeably \nwith clients, and they build on one another. \n\nAdministering and Interpreting the \nMBTI in Career Counseling Settings \n\nPractitioners must first determine if the MBTI is an appro- \npriate tool to use, and second, administer it properly. Third, \nthey nced to spend time verifying type with clients, recog- \nnizing that how clients answered the Indicator may have \nheen affected by their work activities and may not be the \nbest-fit type. General issues and guidelines for adminis- \ntration and interpretation have been covered in Chapters 5 \nand 6, and specifie issues related to counseling and psy- \nchotherapy settings are in Chapter 10. The following issues \nare unique to a career counseling setting. \n\nI. When should 1 use the MBTI? \nIn any career counseling practice the practitioner \nmust first determine what information is needed to \naid the career counseling process and then which, if \nany, instruments are to be administered to help pro- \nvide that information. In part this will depend on the \n\nI \n\nclients issues and state of mind. Usually a framework \nfor understanding ones personality adds greatly to \nthe career counseling process. Thus in general the \nMBTI is appropriate to administer to clients who are \nfunctioning normally and who have at least an \neighth-grade reading level. A survey by Graff, Larri- \nmore, Whitehead, and Hopson (1991) identified the \nMBTI as one of the three most widely used instru- \nments in college settings; the other two were the \nStrong Interest Inventory and the Self-Directed Search, \nboth of which are vocational interest assessments. \nSchadt (1997) noted that the MBTI was the most pos- \nitively regarded intervention activity in her work with \nmidlife women. \n\n. What factors should 1 consider in timing the \n\nadministration? \n\nAny client in crisis needs to have that crisis dealt with \nbefore career counseling interventions are appropri- \nate, and the career counselor may or may not have the \nskill set to handle those situations. Hammer and \nKummerow (1996) present a model of appropriate \nstrategies to use with clients based in part on how \nwell clients know themselves and how clearly their \nvocational interest pattern is formed. For those \nclients who lack self-awareness and a stable sense of \nidentity and who seem unable to differentiate their \ninterests, therapeutic interventions may be more ap- \npropriate than focusing on any career search activi- \nties. Those with a clear sense of self but an unfocused \ninterest pattern may need to explore work activities, \njobs, and work environments. Those with a differenti- \nated interest pattern but who are unsure of them- \nselves may need short-term support and counseling. \nThis may be the case, for example, immediately fol- \nlowing the loss of ones job. Hammer and Kummerow \n(1996) suggest that it is with those who have a sense \nof identity and some knowledge of their interests that \ncareer counseling is suitable. It is at this point that \nadministering the MBTI is most appropriate. \n\n. Which form should I use? \n\nEither Form M or Form K is appropriate, depending \non which *level ol interpretation\" one desires. Form \nK provides the MBTI Step I], which allows for addi- \ntion of a more behavioral interpretation. For those \nwith the required clinical training, Form J may be \nused; it adds Comfort/Discomfort scales. \n\n. Are there any particular cautions in administering \n\nthe MBTI? \n\nThe frame of reference for those taking the MBTI is an \nimportant one. In thinking about their careers, some \npeople wonder if it might be hest to respond to the \nMBTI with their work lives in mind. The answer is \nunequivocally no. ll we are attempting to help people \nfind the roles or situations where they are most likely \n\nUses of Iype in Career Counseling 323 \n\nto work well, then we must concentrate on who they \nare, not on what they do. 1t is when people are work- \ning with their natural prelerences that they are most \nlikely expending the least amount ol energy to do the \ntasks and gaining the most energy from their activi- \nties. This does not take away from the reality that \npeople can and do flex with the situations but rather \nrecognizes that each person has a more natural pref- \nerence in every situation. \n\n. What effect does a work frame of reference seem to \n\nhave on best-fit type? \n\nSeveral studies have looked at the effects of work on \n\ntype verification. Kummerow (1988) asked retail \n\nstore managers who were participants in management \ndevelopment classes to sel-assess and to assess their \ntypes in work situations (that is, how they were actu- \nally doing their work) as well as to verify the type that \nfit them best overall.

Apparently a num- \n\nber of people were using preferences other than their \nmost natural ones at work. \n\nIn a study (Hammer, personal communication) of \nnearly 1,000 people, about 29% verified a type differ- \nent from how they came out on the Indicator itself. \nThe sample was made up of those training to use the \nMBTI professionally, so they were highly attuned to \nthe importance of type verification. Participants who \nverified a type different from what they reported on \nthe Indicator were asked to indicate which of nine \npossible reasons affected their results; respondents \ncould choose as many reasons as were applicable. \nSeveral work-related reasons were included. These \nare listed below along with the percentage of those \nchoosing this as an influence on their Indicator \nresults: \n\ne 32.5%: Aspects of your work that do not match \nyour preferences but which you have mastered, \ne.g., Introverts who work as trainers may learn and \nhave to use some Extraverted skills to get their job \ndone. \n\ne. 22.7%: Pressures from the culture of the organiza- \ntion in which you work, e.g., Perceivers may feel \nthey should be more planned, systematic, and \norganized than they prefer to be, and may strive to \nbehave in that way. \n\n* Among the nine possible reasons, the one indi- \ncated the most was the one pertaining to \"aspects \nof work.\" \n\nThus the research suggests that work may inlluence \n\nthe results on the MBTI but also that interpreters can \n\nuse that information from the work setting to help \nverify the best-fit type. \n\n3 \n\n24 \n\nThe Uses of Type \n\n6. How do I help my clients determine their best- fit \npreferences? \nPractitioners can help clients understand influences of \nwork, comprehend the use of all the functions at work, \nand find a type that best fits the person. A request for \ninformation from the client such as *Describe how you \nuse both your Thinking and your Feeling in your \nwork\" may elicit a great deal of information, including \nwhich function is preferred as well as a reminder that \nthe client does use both. The client may speak of one \nfunction being easier to access than thc other, of one \nrequiring more (or less) energy, ol one being liked \nmore than the other, etc. Through using good counsel- \ning skills, counselors can help the client understand \nwhat they are saying about the functions and what that \nmeans. It is essential in career counseling that practi- \ntioners and clients work with verified typc. That will \ngive the most comprehensive picture of clients and the \nkind of work activities from which they are most likely \nto draw energy and gain satisfaction. \n\n7. What uses of type in career counseling should be \navoided? \nAny approach that stereotypes the person or the \noccupation is inappropriate. Remember that each \nperson has access to all eight preference domains and \nthat many occupations also require the use of all eight \nat least some of the time. Using the MBTI to provide \nthe definitive yes or no to a career search would also \nbe inappropriate since so many factors go into career \nchoice besides personality. \n\nConclusion \n\nThe knowledge of type enhances our understanding of \nclients' preferred work environments, occupational choices, \ninterests, values, satisfactions, self-efficacy, and development. \n\nBy itself, cach area is useful in career counseling, but with \nthe addition of type each becomes even more meaningful. \nCareer development and career counseling are complex \nareas, as is type. \n\nSeveral type-related patterns in this chapter include the \nfollowing: \n\nm The work environment appears to be more of a focus for \nthe Extraverted types than the Introverted ones. \n\nB In occupational selection, the function pairs (ST, SE NE \nNT) play the largest role in shaping the occupational \npattern. \n\nB [n work satisfaction, the attitude pairs (EJ, EP IP, and IJ) \nplay the greatest roles, with the EJs the most satisfied \nand IPs often the least. \n\nm Values appear somewhat shaped by the differences in \nThinking-Feeling, with Feeling types identifying more \nvalues of importance to them than Thinking types. \nExtraverted types also identify more values as important \nthan Introverted types. \n\n Different types have distinctly different interest patterns \nfrom one another. Among the patterns are the NF focus \non self-expression and NT focus on abstract problem \nsolving. \n\nm High self-efficacy or confidence in many areas and its \nlink to high interests in those areas describe ENTs. \n\nW Career decisiveness is related to Judging. \n\nThat the MBTI personality inventory is useful in helping \npeople find meaningful work where they can be productive \nhas been amply illustrated here.

Research (Denison &amp; Mishra, \n1995) and experience demonstrate that the following are \n\ncrucial components of effective organizations: \n\nEmployee iniuative, flexibility, and accountability \nB Inclusion of employees in decision making \n\nB A clear sense of organizational and group mission \nB Flat and fluid hierarchies \n\n8 Flexible and responsive leadership \n\nAs this awareness has developed, employee and leader \ndevelopment programs have grown exponentially to try to \ntransform organizations and the ways people work. \n\nAs investment in employee development and training has \ngrown, so has use of the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator person- \nality inventory, currently exceeding 860,000 administrations \nper year in organizational settings. Some of this use is for \nindividual career development, but the MBTI is also used as \na basic tool in a wide variety of development and training \nprograms focused on organizational effectiveness. \n\nThis more general use of the MBTI as a tool in seemingly \nunrelated training programs has developed because MBTI \nresults, presented within the context of Jungian psychologi- \ncal type theory, have wide applicability to workstyles and \n\n325 \n\n326 ~The Uses of Type \n\ninteractions. A number of qualities account for the MBTI's \nusefulness as a basic tool in employee development: \n\n MBTI results and interpretation focus on how people \ntake in information (perception) and how they prioritize \nthat information to make decisions (judgment) basic \npersonality facets that underlie most work tasks and \n\ntraining. \n\nBg MBTI type enhances peoples clarity and comfort with \ntheir own workstyles while constructively identifying \npossible blind spots and areas of vulnerability. \n\nB Type theory and the MBTI give a logical, coherent struc- \nture for understanding normal differences among people \nin a host of other work-related activities: communication \nstyles, teamwork, project management, time manage- \nment, preferred supervision style and work environment, \nresponses and needs during organizational change, pre- \nferred learning styles, and many more. \n\nB Type theory presents a dynamic picture of individual \nfunctioning, including recognition of the dominant \nfunction as the basis of motivation and identification of \ncustomary responses to stress. \n\nB Type theory outlines a model of lifelong individual \ndevelopment, and the MBTI identifies likely paths for \ndevelopment, useful with work groups and in coaching \nindividual leaders and managers. \n\ng The MBTI provides a perspective and data for analyzing \norganizational culture, management structures, and \nother organizational svstems. \n\nB The MBTI! and supporting type resources demonstrate the \nvalue added by diversity within the organization or work \ngroup. This ethicthe constructive use of differences \nis particularly applicable in todays global and diverse \norganizations. \n\nThese powerful potentials of the MBTI and psychologi- \ncal type result when practitioners administer the instru- \nment appropriately, interpret results correctly, lead clients \nthrough a process of verifying their type, and add the depth \ninherent in the dynamic Jungian theory of personality. The \ntheory and construction sections of this manual equip prae- \nlitioners with the theoretical framework and knowledge of \nthe instrument needed for such in-depth use of type. \n\nThe goal of this chapter is to provide specific, practical \napplications for effective use of the MBTI assessment tool \nin organizations: to outline and illustrate common organi- \nzational uses of the MBTI, suggest appropriate resources, \nand refer to related research of particular interest to practi- \ntioners.

Tables 13.1, 13.2, and 13.3 illustrate patterns of \ntypes found in leadership positions in organizations and \ntypical type distributions among people who work in \nhuman resources and consulting. \n\nType tables of large groups of managers and leaders from \na wide variety of cultures demonstrate an overrepresenta- \ntion of Thinking and Judging, compared to general popula- \ntions (Fitzgerald &amp; Kirby, 1997b). The pattern of TJ man- \nagers and leaders is true even in organizations whose goals \nor work would seem to appeal to people of other types \n(Craig, Craig, &amp; Sleight, 1988; Hawkins, Williams, &amp; \nHawkins, 1990). For example, teaching in elementary \nschools (children 6 to I2 years) seems to attract an overrep- \nresentation of people preferring Feeling compared to the \ngeneral population (DiTiberio, 1996), but type tables of \nprincipals of those schools show the same TJ pattern as for \nleaders in other organizations (Macdaid et al., 1986). \n\nType tables of human resource professionals tend to \nshow higher percentages ol Intuition, Feeling, and Perceiv- \ning types than appear in type tables of management groups. \nTypes of consultants tend to concentrate in the lower right- \nhand quadrant of the type table, the four EN types. Practi- \ntioners can hypothesize that their own most natural style of \ngathering information, organizing it, and delivering propos- \nals will need to be modified to speak effectively to organiza- \ntional leaders and decision makers. \n\nTable 13.1 \n\nUses of Type in Organizations 327 \n\nType Distribution of Participants in the Center for Creative Leadership's \nLeadership Development Program in Percentages \n\n52.576 \n47 5% \n49.7% \n50.3% \n79.6% \n20.4% \n68.9% \n31.1% \n\n57.876 \n21.876 \n| 1.076 \n\n9.376 \n\n41.176 \n38.576 \n11.7% \n\n8.6% \n\n28.6% \n25.9% \n23.8% \n21.6% \n\n29.1% \n21.3% \n[2.5% \n[2.2% \n10.4% \n6.2% \n4.6% \n3.6% \n\nNote: N = 26,477. \n\nSource: From The Relationship Between the MBTI and Measures of Personality and Performance in Management Groups, by J W Fleenor, \n1997, m Developing Leaders, p 119 Palo Alto, CA.

Instead, practitioners can use their knowledge of the \nbasic needs associated with each type dichotomy to ensure \nthat proposals address the primary concerns of decision \nmakers: \n\nm E-I: Include time for questions and discussions (E) and \nwritten information provided ahead of time (1). \n\nB S-N: Include the specifics (who, when, what, how, and \nhow much) along with examples of the MBTTs use in \nother similar organizations (S) and the future vision of \nhow it connects to current problems and could trans- \nform the organization (N). \n\nm I-F: Include the logical, objective rationale and cost- \nbenefit analysis (T) and the ways in which the MBTI con- \nnects to the mission and values of the organization (F). \n\nm J-P: Include suggested structures, plans, and time \nframes (J) and planned flexibility for midcourse changes \nas new information comes in or the needs change (P). \n\nUsing a type perspective also ensures that practitioners \nhave covered the bases in developing their proposal. \n\nResources \n\nPractitioners can draw on two resources in developing and \npresenting their proposals: Using the Myers-Briggs Type Indi- \ncator in Organizations (Hirsh, 1990) and Type and Change:",

They indicated the problems presented by \nthe culture of the group and organization, and reported \nmodifications they made to provide a better fit with the \n\n330 The Uses of Type \n\norganizational culture. Their process provides a model for \ntaking specific organizational cultures into account in intro- \nductory sessions. \n\nResources The recommended resource for introductory \ntype workshops is Introduction to Type (Myers, with Kirby &amp; \nMyers, 1998) for each participant. It presents all the infor- \nmation practitioners need to include in the session, provides \n\na structure for participant type verification, describes each of \n\nthe 16 types in full, outlines several type applications, and \ngives important guidelines for using type and avoiding \nmisuses. Introduction to Type in Organizations (Hirsh &amp; \nKummerow, 1998) presents basic type information specif- \nically relevant to organizations. Using the Myers-Briggs Type \nIndicator in Organizations (Hirsh, 1990) provides repro- \nducible masters for overhead presentations in introductory \nworkshops. Valuing Preferences in the Workplace (Brock &amp; \nKummerow, n.d.) is a handout for participants in intro- \nductory workshops and includes a leaders guide with \nsuggestions for use in organizations. \n\nResearch for Practitioners Research from the national \n\nsample and reports from organization development \nspecialists (Hirsh, 19922) indicate that peoples descriptions \nof ideal work environments illustrate all the dichotomies \nidentified by the MBTI. This makes the last activity \nsuggesteddesigning an ideal work environmentan \neffective way to clarify and apply type with an introductory \ngroup. \n\nTable 12.5 in Chapter 12, page 289, presents relation- \nships between MBTI preferences on Form M and subscales \non the Work Environment Scale (WES) for a group of uni- \nversity employees. Tables 12.6, 12.7, and 12.8 (on pages \n289, 290, and 291, respectively) present research on the \npreferred work environments identified by whole types in \nthe national sample of adults gathered by Consulting Psy- \nchologists Press in its development and testing of Form M \nitems. (See Chapter 7, pages 156-157, and the Appendix \nfor descriptions of this sample and the research). \n\nPractitioners can use this rescarch information to struc- \nture and inform their debriefing of the exercise on ideal \nwork environments, allowing them to highlight typical \nMBTI-related components in the presentations of different \ntype groups. \n\nSummary \n\nIntroducing psychological type and the MBTI into organi- \nzations can be exciting and rewarding for practitioners, \nclients, and the organization. Type theory is positive and \nsupportive, the examples and type descriptions fit people, \nand the possibilities for application and integration into \ndaily life are almost limitless (Brock, 1996). Introducing the \nMBTI well supports individual workstyles and needs and \nencourages employee self-confidence, development, flexi- \nbility, and autonomy. \n\nOn the other hand, if type is introduced briefly and per- \nfunctorily, clients forget their letters and don't make use \nof type knowledge; or when they do use it, they tend to \nstereotype and label others. An unbiased introduction, with \nattention to type verification and to the full type descrip- \ntions, and some opportunities to apply the information to \nspecific day-to-day work settings provide the best guarantee \nthat clients and the organization will profit from the bene- \nfits and avoid the potential pitfalls. \n\nIntroducing and Using the Dynamic \nand Developmental Aspects of Type \n\nCarl G. Jungs theory of personality is dynamic and develop- \nmental. The preferences do not exist in isolation but instead \ninteract with each other to form distinctive personality pat- \nterns. The resulting psychological types are not static boxes \ninto which people fitthey evolve and become more effec- \ntive as people learn and develop. Myers and Briggs opera- \ntionalized Jungs dynamic model in the MBTI, and the influ- \nence of each preference on the others underlies the type \ndescriptions in Introduction to Type (Myers, with Kirby &amp; \nMyers, 1998). \n\nThe dynamic and developmental components of Jungs \ntheory offer some of the most powerful applications of the \nMBTI, but this potential is often underused in organiza- \ntions. Placing type within this Jungian framework also leads \nclients away from stereotyping and from feeling stereotyped \nor \"boxed in.\" \n\nUsing this deeper interpretive level in conjunction with \nthe MBTI expands its usefulness, providing the basis for the",

This clarifies com- \nmunication styles (Yeakley, 1982, 1983) and is especially \nhelpful for those who prefer Introversion. \n\nW It highlights the role of the dominant tunctiona cen- \ntral part of individual identity. Research (Hammer, 19962) \nand practice (Barger &amp; Kirby, 1995a; Kummerow, Barger, \n&amp; Kirby, 1997) indicate that identifying a types domi- \nnant function illuminates core values and motivations \n(for example, sec this chapters section on dealing with \norganizational change). \n\nB [i creates awareness of the need for the balance poten- \ntially provided by a persons auxiliary functionbalance \nbetween perception and judgment and between extravert- \ning and introverting. \n\nB |t provides a framework for recognizing type-consistent \n\nreactions to everyday stress and consistent but out-of- \ncharacter reactions to excessive stress. \n\nB |t leads people to explore the impacts of midlife develop- \n\nmental periods. \n\nm it includes a model of lifelong development that can \nguide self-assessment and identification of developmen- \ntal goals. \n\nLike MBTI type, these dynamic and developmental per- \nspectives identily areas for individual growth and improvc- \nment of interactions among people in a nonjudgmental way. \n\nPresenting Type Dynamics and Development \nin an Organizational Setting \n\nEvery introduction to the MBTI and type needs to include \nstatements about the dynamic nature of type theory: that a \npsychological type is much more than the adding together \nof four separate preferences and that cach type is a unique \ncombination based on the interactions of the preferences \nwithin that type. It is also helpful to state that the prefer- \nences indicated by the MBTI are underlying patterns whose \nexpression and development are influenced by a host of \nenvironmental factors such as parents and family, educa- \ntion, cultural values, religion, individual life experiences, \nprofession, and so on. \n\nPractitioners can deepen their own understanding of \ntype dynamics and development through reading ( Chapters \n3 and 4 of this manual; Myers &amp; Kirby, 1994) and observa- \ntion. Though type tables such as the one in Chapter 3, page \n31, provide a quick guide to each types dynamics, practition- \ners will fec} most comfortahleand will be most effective \nwhen they understand the theory underlying dynamics and \ncan give examples from their own experience. \n\nClients typically can understand and make use of type \ndynamics and development with a relatively brief explana- \ntion. This explanation can be integrated into a standard \n\"introduction to type\" session or presented in a follow-up \nsession. \n\nIntegrating Dynamics into the Introduction to Type \nPractitioners who include the dynamic picture of type in \nintroductory sessions typically do this by presenting the \nfollowing points: \n\nm In MBTI theory, each type has a favorite mental process, \ncalled the dominant function. It forms the core identity \nand direction for the overall personality. In Gifts Differ- \ning Isabel Myers called it the general (Myers with \nMyers, 1980/1995). Your dominant function will be one \nof the two middle letters in your four-letter type. \n\ng That favorite mental process is normally used in your \nfavorite world: the outer world for those who prefer Extra- \nversion, the inner world for those who prefer Introversion. \nMyers said the extraverted dominant function is like the \ngeneral who goes out into the field, overseeing and direct- \ning everyone. The introverted dominant function is like a \ngeneral who stays inside the tent, sending out orders. \n\ng When we talk about types in this way, we use terms such \nas an Extraverted Intuitive type, meaning a type that \nextraverts its dominant function of Intuition. \n\nUses of Type in Organizations 331 \n\nm The other middle letter of the type is called the auxiliary \nfunction. It assists the dominant function (Myers \nlikened it to the generals aide-de-camp) by providing \nbalance between perception and judgment and between \nextraverting and introverting. So if your dominant func- \ntion is one of the perceiving functions (S or N), your \nauxiliary function will be T or E whichever you preter. \nThis gives people a comfortable way of taking in infor- \nmation and making decisions. And if you prefer Intro- \nversion and therefore use your dominant function \ninside, we would expect you to use your auxiliary helper \nto deal with the outside worldits what you normally \nextravert. This gives people comfortable ways of ex- \ntraverting and introverting. \n\nThe practitioner then focuses on the four-letter type \nindicated by MBTI results, pointing out that the four letters \nidentify 16 different underlying patterns of perceiving, \njudging, and directing energy: \n\nIntroducing Dynamics and Development in Follow-Up",

Then, at a follow-up session, \npractitioners can refer back to those statements and remind \nclients that S and N are two different ways of perceiving, T \nand F two opposite ways of judging. They can then explain \ndynamics quickly, using the discussion of dynamics in \nIntroduction to Type (Myers, with Kirby &amp; Myers, 1998) and \nmaking points similar to those listed above. \n\nUsing Type Descriptions to Illustrate Dynamics \n\nWhichever way dynamics are introduced, the type descrip- \ntions in Introduction to Type provide a practical way to illus- \ntrate dynamics.

For example, the tide of \nthe first type description is ISTJIntroverted Sensing with \nExtraverted Thinking. \n\nSccond, notice the Characteristics section: The first \nparagraph defines the dominant function and indicates \nwhether it is normally used inside or is extraverted. The \nsecond paragraph describes the auxiliary function in its \ncustomary attitude. \n\nThird, the section on How Others May See Them\" cap- \ntures what this type extraverts (and therefore what others \nsee) and what this type introverts. \n\nThe final section of the type descriptions, Potential \nAreas for Growth, outlines developmental patterns: what \ncan happen if the dominant and auxiliary functions are not \n\nSee, The Uses of Type \n\ndeveloped and used well, what happens to types under \nstress, indications of lack of development and use of the \nnonpreferred funetions, and common examples of erup- \ntions of the inferior funetion. \n\nApplying Type Dynamics and Development \n\nTo assist clients in using this information to deepen self- \nunderstanding and their understanding of colleagues, prac- \ntitioners can form dominant-alike groups (types who usc \nthe same dominant function in the same attitude) and ask \nthem to discuss questions such as the following: \n\ng What do you extravert? How do you experience that? \nHow do others? What do you introvert? How do you \nexperience that? How do others? \n\nm How does your dominant function find support in your \nwork? How does your auxiliary function provide balance? \n\nm Looking at yourself in childhood, can you see examples \nof your use and development of the dominant function? \n\nThe remaining sections on organizational applications \nfrequently draw on this deeper level of type understanding, \nand the suggestions for activities there can also be used to \nillustrate dynamics. \n\nResources \n\nAs indicated above, the brief description of type dynamics \nin Introduction to Type, along with analysis of the type \ndescription, is enough for clients to begin to use dynamics. \nIf dynamics are introduced in a follow-up session, thisisa \ngood time to use Introduction to Tvpe in Organizations (Hirsh \n&amp; Kummerow, 1998). This booklet provides a review of the \nbasie dichotomies with word lists and includes  section on \ntype dynamics as well as other organizational applications \nthat will be mentioned later in this chapter. \n\nFor practitioners and for clients who want to explore \nfurther, Introduction to Type Dynamics and Development \n(Myers &amp; Kirby, 1994) gives a deeper explanation of those \ntopies, suggests typical interactions of dominant and auxil- \niary functions, defines the differences when functions are \nextraverted and introverted, and gives examples of using \ndynamics to understand work interactions. The second half \nof the booklet outlines Jungs developmental model, dis- \ncusses typical problems or issues that arise for people, \nexplores midlife development, and offers suggestions of \nways people can experience preferences that they normally \ndo not use. \n\nResearch for Practitioners \n\nChapter 4 of this manual presents a varicty of research stud- \nies based on type dynamics. Tables 4.8, 4.9, 4.10, and 4.11, \nfor example, summarize research by the first and last letters \nof types: IJ, IP, EP, and EJ. Commonalities among these \nfour types that appear in the rows of the type table relate \nto the dichotomy (S-N or T-F) that they extravert and the \n\ndichotomy that they introvert. For example, the IJ types are \nthe four types who extravert their auxiliary judging function \nand introvert their dominant perceiving function, and so on. \n\nAll research that looks at whole types, as opposed to \npreferences or preference combinations, also provides \ninformation about the dynamic interactions within that \ntype.

An ENFP, for example, may rec- \nognize during the session that co-workers who prefer Sens- \ning have a difficult time \"seeing\" their vision when the \nENFP presents it in enthusiastic, big-picture terms.

Talking in Type (Kummcerow, 1987) is a short \nhandout describing the basic needs of each preference and \nhow to adjust ones conversational style to communicate \nmore effectively. \n\nAdditional information useful as background for practi- \ntoners or for use with clients who wish to pursue this topic \nin depth may be found in the following: \n\nWORK Types (Kummerow, Barger, &amp; Kirby, 1997), espe- \ncially Chapter 2, includes discussion of communication \nstyle by preference, with tips for communicating more \n\neffectively directed to those preferring Extraversion, those \npreferring Introversion, and so on.

It appears in Table 13.6. \n\nDealing with Conflict \n\nConflicts develop for a host of reasons unrelated to psycho- \nlogical type: differences in culture, race, gender, and ethnic \nidentification; differences in religion, social views, politics, \npersonal commitments, and other important identifying \nvalues; differences in background, personal life events, edu- \ncation, and other shaping experiences; and competitive \npressures within work. Because psychological type explains \nimportant differences in communication style, information \ngathering and giving, decision making, and structuring the \nenvironment, however, type-related differences often lead \nor contribute to normal conflicts between colleagues. Expe- \nrienced practitioners have found that MBTI type differences \nsometimes play a role in confliets that may seem to be about \nother things. In this case, untangling the type-related parts \nof the conflict and working to resolve them ean provide a \ncooperative base for moving ahead to deal with other, unre- \nlated issues. \n\nThis section addresses integrating type with conllict res- \nolution models, common sources of conflict between peo- \nple with opposite preferences, and using type to provide \nbridges for resolving conflicts that are not specifically about \n\ntype differences. It concludes with suggested resources and \nreferences to research. \n\nIntegrating Type with \na Conflict Resolution Model \n\nPsychologists and sociologists have developed models that \nprovide a structure for resolving conflicts (Kilmann &amp; \nThomas, 1975). All of these models suggest ways to avoid \nor get beyond a win/lose approach to conflict, where one \nside is right and the other is clearly wrong. \n\nPractitioners use of any such models in resolving con- \nflicts will be strengthened by integrating type: \n\nm it identifies and affirms an individuals natural style of \ndealing with conflict. \n\nm t makes clear that others will have a very different style \nthat is equally right for them. \n\ngm it supports modifying natural styles to interact more \neffectively. \n\nThis ethic of the MBTIthe constructive use ol diller- \nences provides a framework and perspective for using any \nconflict resolution approach.",

The following are \nbricf descriptions of conflicts frequently experienced by co- \nworkers who differ on a particular type dichotomy. These \ndescriptions can be a beginning point for practitioners to \nsharpen their skills in identifying type-related components \nof conflicts. \n\nExtraversion-Introversion Conllicts here frequently relate \nto two areas: (1) quick versus more measured pacing and \n(2) breadth/changeability of topics versus focus. \n\nThe natural pace ol those who prefer Extraversion is \nrapid. They develop their ideas by talking about them. As \n\nthey talk, their thoughts become clearer to them; conse- \nquently they often change direction during the course of \ndiscussions. \n\nThose who prefer Introversion usually want to process \ninternally and need some talk-free time and space to do so. \nThe thinking-out-loud process of those preferring Extraver- \nsion can interfere with their thinking-inside process. Addi- \ntionally, when people preferring Introversion tune back into \nthe conversation, they may find the discussion has shifted \nto a different topic. \n\nThe opposites on this dichotomy often experience con- \nflict, with Extraverts labeling the Introverts as withholding \nor not interested, while Introverts experience Extraverts as \ninvasive. And each may think the other is avoiding the \ntopic. \n\nSensing-Intuition Two conflicts that frequently develop \nrelated to differences in this dichotomy are (1) agreement \non what the problem is and (2) a focus on experience versus \na focus on theories. \n\nFor Sensing types, the problem or conflict is defined hy \nwhat actually happened, usually concrete events: John is \nlate for our meetings 90% of the time. Intuitive types are \nmore likely to see specific behavior as part of a pattern that \nthey think is the real problem: John has difficulty dealing \nwith authority figures.\" For Intuitive types, taking some \naction to ensure that John arrives on time to meetings doesnt \ndeal with the real problem. For Sensing types, difficulty \nwith authority figures has litthe meaning and no solution. \n\nWhen conflicts or problems arise, Sensing types tend to \nreflect on their experience and trust what they know has \nworked before in similar situations. Intuitive types are more \nlikely to find theoretical explanations and solutions persua- \nsive: A new book or new interpretation seems more altrac- \ntive and more likely to achieve long-term results. \n\nSensing types and Intuitive types sometimes end up in a \nconflict where each thinks the other \"just doesnt get it \n(the problem), with Sensing tvpes seeing Intuitive types as \nunrealistic or off the wall and Intuitive types seeing Sens- \ning types as \"shooting down\" their ideas. \n\nThinking-Feeling Two frequent conflicts related to this \ndichotomy are (1) searching for the right answer versus \nexploration of peoples ideas and (2) choosing the logical \nalternative and applying it to everyone versus finding indi-",

    "content": "vidual solutions that work for people. \n\nThinking types tend to believe that if a problem can be \ndefined accurately and the relevant evidence gathered, there \nwill be a correct solution, and thats what people should do. \nFeeling types are much more likely to think that truth is \nnot cut and dried: Whats right for one may be wrong for \nanother. The solution will be found by gathering many per- \nspeetives and finding the answer that fits best for everyone. \n\nFor Thinking types, the answer that is correct is gener- \nally the one supported by logie and reasonthe objective \nperspective, with personal considerations and emotions \n\nseparated out. For Feeling types, personal considerations \nidentify the solution: The best answer is found through \nempathizing with those involved and finding ways to sup- \nport them. \n\nThinking types may experience the decision-making \nprocess of Feeling types as irrational, inconsistent, and \nillogical. Feeling types may experience the decision making \nof Thinking types as cold and uncaring. \n\nJudging-Perceiving Two of the normal conflicts related to \nthis dichotomy are (1) the need for structure versus the need \nfor flexibility and (2) the desire for closure versus the desire \nfor openness (waiting). \n\nJudging types want clear goals; then they create plans, \nstructures, and time frames to achieve them. Perceiving \ntypes typically want clear goals and a deadline; then they \nwant to be trusted to meet them in their own ways. \n\nJudging types want decisions and closure. Ambiguity, \ndelayed decisions, reopening decisions, and changing goals \nare extremely uncomfortable to them. Perceiving types, on \nthe other hand, want decisions to grow out of the process. \nMaking a decision because its time, or because the Judg- \ning type wants one, often {cels forced, premature, and likely \nto be the wrong decision to Perceiving types. They have \nfaith in their own internal sense of timing and trust that \nwhen the right time comes, they will know: Now is the \ntime; now I know what we should do. \n\nJudging types often have trouble trusting that Perceiving \ntypes will come through in a timely way, that decisions will \nbe made and action will be taken. Perceiving types often \nfeel hemmed in, limited, and restricted by Judging types. \n\nThese are not the only type-related confliets that practi- \ntioners may see in work settings, but they are some of the \nmost common. As practitioners watch work interactions \nthrough a type lens, they will be able to identify such con- \nflicts more confidently. \n\nThe Advantages of Recognizing Type in Conflicts The \nbenefits of recognizing these components in conflicts is that \nthe type perspective tends to depersonalize disagreements. \nColleagues shift from seeing each other as wrong, or willfully \nobstructive, to recognizing that each is operating out of a \nvalid perspective that needs to be heard and honored in the \nresolution of the conflict. Conflict resolution becomes much \neasier when both parties invest in the constructive use of \ndifferences. \n\nUsing Type as a Bridge in \n\nDealing with Other Conflicts \n\nPractitioners have found type is one way to forge common \nground in conflict situations that are unrelated to type dil- \n\nferences. Recognizing type differences may be useful in the \nfollowing kinds of situations: \n\nm Two departments merge, but old loyalties remain. \n\nUses of Type in Organizations 337 \n\nB A team is formed, with people representing dilterent \nparts of the organization and having very different prior- \nities and approaches. \n\nm Colleagues from different cultural, racial, ethnic, or edu- \ncational backgrounds find they have difficulty develop- \ning the trust necessary to work together effectively. \n\nB Anorganization acquircs another company and integrates \nemployees, but finds that the organizational cultural dil- \nferences are getting in the way of anticipated benefits. \n\nIn all of these examples, very real differences in culture, \nstyles, and values need to be negotiated. This works best \nwhen the people involved can find commonalities as well as \ndifferences, which are often all too clear. One way of doing \nthis is to work with them to find their common ground\" \n(Weisbord, 1992): the goals they share for their work, their \ndesire for congenial and supportive colleagues, their com- \nmitment to the organizations success, and so on. \n\nUsing the MBTI with such groups can provide common \nground on an individual level: People with very different \ncultural values and stylesorganizational or national \nfind it easy to talk about their type preference similarities \n(Kirby &amp; Barger, 1996). They frequently find similar atti- \ntudes toward school, authority, working on teams, collegial \nrelationships, communication styles, and a number of other \ntype-related behaviors and values. These personal connec- \ntions developed through use of the MBTI can provide \nrespect and trust between type-alike people as thev work to \nnegotiate their differences.",

An international communications company rcorga- \nnized to gain greater efficiency. This process resulted in the \nforming of a team composed of research and development \nspecialists in Sidney, Australia, and Denver, Colorado. They \ndid much of their team work at long distance, using e- \nmail, fax, and phonc. But the time came when they needed \nto get together, and the Australians came to Denver to work \nfor several months. Problems immediately surfaced that \nseemed to be about gender, sex discrimination, social and \npolitical value differences, and race. The American team was \nheaded by a woman (not unheard of in this U.S. company). \nThe Australians were unaccustomed to women in leadership \nroles in technical fields and tended to go to her male assis- \ntant for information and direction. And they made jokes that \nwere offensive to all of the U.S. women on the team. Mean- \nwhile, the Australians continued to be annoyed that the \nAmericans seemed to know little about Australia, including \nnever being able to get the time/date difference right. \n\nA desperate call to a practitioner who had done numer- \nous workshops with the U.S. members of this team resulted \nin a workshop using typc and culture concepts to look at \nsimilarities and differences. Participants first had an intro- \nduction to type and worked in type-alike groups to identity \ncommon strengths and weaknesses, typc-related values and \nbehaviors, and so on. \n\n338 The Uses of Type \n\nThen they were grouped by cultureAustralia and \nU.S.and asked to answer a number of questions about \ntheir countries. Finally, Australians and Americans were \nput together to exchange information about cultural values \n\nand behaviors. \n\nThe commonalities identified in the typc-alike groups and \nthe bonding around you do it that way too? earried over \ninto the cross-cultural discussions. Participants had devel- \noped respect as they worked together in the type groups and \nwere willing to listen to the information about cultural differ- \nences. Interestingly, the worst offender with racial- and \ngender-stereotyping jokes turned out to be the same type as \nthe African-American woman team leader. They had an ener- \ngizing discussion in their type-alike group about all the ways \npeople had misunderstood them and, though the racial and \ngender differences didn't disappear, they were able to discuss \nthem in an atmosphere of mutual respect. \n\nPractitioners must never ignore or minimize very real differ- \nences in the perspectives and experiences of people of dif- \nferent organizational, cultural, or racial backgrounds; but type \ncan be a bridgea tool for finding commonality among very \ndifferent peopleand can create an atmosphere where those \nother differences can be discussed with mutual respect and \nappreciation. \n\nUsing Type in Diversity Training \n\nThe context and ethics of the MBTI assessment tool support \nand encourage diversity: recognizing normal, in-born differ- \nences between people; respecting peoples right to be who \nthey are and to contribute in the ways that are appropriate \nfor them; appreciating gifts differing (the title of Isabel \nMyers 1980 book explaining psychological type); and nego- \ntiating so that each person gets what he or she needs. The \nMBTIS support of the \"constructive use of differences\" has \nled some practitioners to use the MBTI as part of diversity \ntraining programs (Lund, 1995). \n\nThere are few published resources and little research on \nuses of the MBTI in diversity training. Until such informa- \ntion is available, practitioners are urged to proceed with \ncaution. The ethical prineiples related to the MBTI assume \nthat chents can report their natural preferences, claim their \nunique personality patterns, assert their right to be differ- \nent, and negotiate for mutual respect and support of differ- \nenecs. These assumptions do not describe the reality for \nmany co-cultural groups in the United States and other \ncountries, where the dominant culture has defined cultural \nvalues, apptopriate behaviors and personalities, and so on. \n\nMBII type cannot be used to gloss over or minimize the \ndiversity issues of clients from cultures that historically \nhave been oppressed. For example, those preferring Intro- \nversion in the United States customarily report that they \nhave grown up facing biases about their natural introverted \nbehaviors and pressures to be someone they are not. \n\nResearch evidence (Chapter 9; Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985) \nconfirms that many natural intreverted behaviors are por- \ntrayed by other psychologieal instruments in very negative \nways. And observers interpretations of Introverted behav- \niors can be largely negative (Thorne &amp; Gough, 1991). \nThese experiences may help those preferring Introversion \nto develop understanding and sympathy toward others who",

The \nintensity of conflicts can be greatly increased if one of the \nparties uses type concepts in a way that stereotypes or \n\"explains away the others perspective. \n\nVan Sants experience suggests that type may also not be \nhelpful when it becomes a way of intellectualizing a conflict \nto avoid acknowledging and validating the emotions expe- \nrienced by the parties in the conflict. \n\nResources \n\nSeveral of the type resources alrcady mentioned provide \ninformation that will assist practitioners in recognizing \ntype-related conflicts: Introduction to Type (1998), Introduc- \ntion to Type in Organizations (1998), I'm Not Crazy, l'm Just \nNot You (1997), and others. Van Sant and Payne (1995) \nfocus on using type in education, but their chapter on \n\"Confliet Resolution has much wider applicability. It \nincludes discussions of frequent conflict areas related to \ntype preference differences; outlines approaches to solving \nconflicts typical of the function pairs (ST, SE NT, and NF); \nand provides suggestions, tips, and a process for resolving \nconflicts with different types. \n\nResearch for Practitioners \n\nEarly research on psychological type and conflict (Kilmann \n&amp; Thomas, 1975; Mills, Robey, &amp; Smith, 1985) found, in \ngeneral, that Thinking types tended to be assertive and \ncompetitive in conflict situations, Feeling types favored \ncooperation and accommodation, and those preferring \nIntroversion avoided conflict. \n\nTable 13.7 Preferred Conflict Styles of Types \n\nDominant Extraverted Thinking (ET]s) \nMales \nFemales \n\ne eee  \n\nCompete \n\nCompromise \n\n s ron \n\nDominant Introverted Thinking (ITPs) \n\nColumn Radio 7 27-297 n RA \n\nCompromise \n\n  \n\nAuxiliary Extraverted Thinking (ITJs) Compromise \nAuxiliary Introverted Thinking (ETPs) Compromise \nDominant Extraverted Feeling (EFJs) Collaborate \nDominant Introverted Feeling (IFPs) Accommodate \nAuxiliary Extraverted Feeling (IFJs) Accommodate \nAuxiliary Introverted Feeling (EFPs) Accommodate \n\nSource: From Myers-Briggs Type Indicator and Confhct-Handling Intention: An \nInteractive Approach, by T.

He saw this as \nnecessary because increasing demands on managers would \nsoon make their job responsibilities overwhelming. The line \nmanagers, who were primarily Sensing types, rejected the \nplan because we're doing OKif it aint broke, dont fix it. \nA year later, as their job responsibilities had grown, many of \nthe managers saw the wisdom of the CEOs foresight. \n\nWhen people do not include the Thinking perspective in \ndecision making, they may \n\nB Fail to assess the logical consequences of each alternative \n\nB Respond primarily to the needs of the people in the \nimmediate situation \n\nB Be overly influenced by the views of trusted people \n\nB Devclop solutions that are inconsistent with previous \ndecisions or organizational policies \n\nThe volunteer board of a nonprofit career development \ncenter consisting primarily of Fecling types found that their \n\n339 \n\n340 The Uses of Type \n\ndecision making was not working well for the center: They \nhad failed to raise client fees when they needed to and had \napproved expenditures for good and valuable activities for \nwhich they did not really have the funds. In assessing the \ndecision making ihat had led them into this financial hole, \nthey recognized that their meetings focused on trying to \naccommodate the views of all the board members and that \nthey had persuaded themselves that good programs would \nresult in increased clients and would pay their own way. \n\nWhen people do not include the Feeling perspective in \ndecision making, they may \n\nB De limited by failing to get information from the people \nwho are involved \n\nB Ignore the impacts on peoples life and work \n\n8 Forget to evaluate the decision by organizational or \ngroup values \n\nB Develop solutions that are logical but impossible to actu- \nally achieve \n\nAlter an introduction to type workshop, the leadership \nteam of a medical center, consisting entirely of Thinking \ntypes, exclaimed, We wish we'd had this before we an- \nnounced our latest reorganization. We planned everything \nso meticulously. The reorganization was state of the art, and \nour rationale was brilliant. But we forgot the people. When \nwe announced it, we really got sandbagged.\" \n\nUsing the Information \n\nOnce a group has analyzed the members usual decision- \nmaking style, it can do as the medieal center lcadership \nteam above did: The team produeed a chart for the wall of \nthe conference room that listed the four funetions and \nquestions commonly assoeiated with the functions. They \nput Feeling judgment and the questions related to that in \nred letters and committed to each other that they would \nreview each deeision with the chart before finalizing. \nKendall and Carr (1997) report using a similar approach in \ntheir Looking Glass courses, which use management sim- \nulations to improve leadership and decision making. \n\nThe Missing Feeling Function \n\nThe function most frequently ignored in deeision making in \nWestern organizations (Fitzgerald &amp; Kirby, 1997b) is Feel- \ning judgment. Rescarch on managers and leaders of organi- \nzations reports an overrepresentation of Thinking types in \nproportion both to the overall population and to reports of \nthe Thinking-Fecling distributions within organizations. \n\nThe cultural values of organizations tend to support \nThinking approaches to decision making: Be objective, \ndetached, hard headed; put emotions and loyalty aside; fol- \nlow the logic wherever it leads. The results of such one- \nsided decision making can create serious problems (Noer, \n1995; Molpus, 1997).",

    "content": "Organizational Change Experts \n\nThis revolution in the ways people work and organizations \nare structured has spawned a host of analyses, blueprints, \nand guides to effective organizational change. In type terms, \nalmost all of these are NT blueprints: They give the rational \nanalysis and the big picture, usually leaving out the spe- \ncifics (S) of exactly what this will look like and how to get \nfrom here to there. They also tend to ignore the Feeling per- \nspective of what people need to survive and prosper in \nthe new organization. Both William Bridges (1992b, 1994) \nand David Noer (1993) focused their organizational change \nwork on the people of the organization. \n\nEven when these change experts recognize the impacts \non people, they typically have not taken into account the \n\nnormal differences in how people respond to organizational \nchange, what they need to accept and support change, and \nthe particular strengths and weaknesses ihey may bring to \nthe current organizational environment. (Bridges, 1994, is \nthe partial exception: in the career development section of \nJobShift he includes a bricf temperament discussion.) \n\nIn type terms, most attention to the people during \norganizational change seems to be a recommendation that \neveryone act like ENTPs (For example, see Pritchett, n.d.): \n\nB FE: Look outward to the market, network with people, \ntake quick action. \n\nB N: See the big picture, have vision, use out-of-the-box \nthinking. \n\nB I: Recognize that the past is gone, move ahead in a \ndetached and rational way to fit vourself into the future. \n\nB P: Be flexible, change directions quickly, give up the \nneed for structure. \n\nIn some ways, this makes sense: The advice is that every \nemployee become an entrepreneur, take charge of his or her \nown work life; and, indeed, type distributions of entre- \npreneurs tend to show an overrepresentation of NTPs \n(Reynierse, 1997). From a type perspective of normal dif- \nferences and the value of all types, however, this exhorta- \ntion to, in effect, change ones type is not very useful.

One of the pri- \nmary reasons for problems that arise during organizational \nchange is that, typically, a small group of leaders or a task \nforce has analyzed the present, explored the options, and \nthen made a decision. They announce this exciting reorga- \nnization or restructuring only to find most others in the \norganization raising doubts, critiquing, feeling anxious, and \nlosing motivation.

What \nwill we do to support people during the change? What \nkinds of values are held by those making the decisions? Do \nI trust them? \n\nFor those responsible for leading organizational change, \nincluding people in these ways often seems too time- \nconsuming and confusingall those different questions and \nideas! This can be particularly challenging to that majority of \nleaders whose type includes Thinking and Judging. TJs like \nto make decisions by gathering relevant information and \nchoosing the most logical alternative. They then want to \nstate goals and a plan and move ahead to implement. \n\nHowever, Thinking-Judging types also highly value \nbeing effective and competent.

His recognition of the need to grieve about what \nis being lost and his description of the confusions of the \nneutral zone are particularly helpful, and he includes a lot \nof information about supporting people through this process. \n\nBridges model of transition stages provided the struc- \nture for Barger and Kirby's The Challenge of Change in Orga- \nnizations (1995), which integrates the responses and needs \nof different types during each stage. Their findings about \nthe Thinking-Feeling dichotomy and Bridges endings \nare summarized in Table 13.10. Because they found that \neach type has its own pattern in responding to organiza- \ntional change, Barger and Kirby include one-page sum- \nmaries for each of the 16 types, with information about \nwhat each type contributes, what each finds difficult, and \ntypical ways each resists change. \n\nBarger and Kirby (1997a, 1997b) also wrote MBTI Type \nand Change and MBTI Type and Change Participants Guide, a \nstructured program with reproducible masters for using the \nMBTI with people in organizations undergoing change. \nTopics include developing a metaphor for change: MBTI \ntype preferences and change; dealing with the impact ot \norganizational change; dealing with loss and grieving; and \nrestoring identity and meaning. Along with workshop \nagendas, scripts, and exercises on these topics, the guide \nalso gives directions for adapting the programs to specific \norganizations and situations. \n\n344 The Uses of Type \n\nSandra Hirshs (1992a) MBTI Team Building Program \nincludes a section on helping teams deal with organizational \nchange, focusing on the four quadrants of the type table: IS, \nES, IN, and EN. Her approach described there, with repro- \nducible masters and a team participant guide, has wider \napplicability and can be used throughout the organization. \n\nWORK Types (Kummerow, Barger, &amp; Kirby, 1997) pro- \nvides suggestions for individual employees in a chapter on \nmanaging change, while Barger &amp; Kirbys organizational \nchange chapter in Developing Leaders (1997c) focuses on \nleaders of different types. \n\nResearch for Practitioners \n\nWalck (1996) summarized studies ol leaders during cbange. \nSeveral correlated MBTI preferences with the Kirton Adap- \ntion and Innovation Inventory (KAL). They generally found \nsignificant correlations between \"Innovation\" on the KAI \nand preferences for Intuition and Perceiving on the MBTI; \nconversely, Adaptation correlated with MBTI preferences \nfor Sensing and Judging. \n\nSuch rescarchlike much of the current expert advice \non organizational changeneeds to be interpreted with \ncare by practitioners. The bias of change experts is for \ntransformational change, and NPs are most likely to \nexhibit characteristics associated with this. However, trans- \nformational change programs have a high rate of failure, \nperhaps in part because of the missing type perspectives. \n\nClancys (1997) analysis of STJs during organizational \nchange provides a crucial perspective for recognizing these \ntypes contributions to change and their style of leading \nchange programs. Her chapter addresses the conventional \nwisdom in the type community (p. +15)that STJs have \nthe most difficulty dealing with organizational changeby \nlisting STJ behaviors that are interpreted by others as resis- \ntance and then explaining their basis and purpose for STJs. \nShe also identifies what STJs need in order to support orga- \nnizational change programs. \n\nBecause STJs comprise so great a part of the workforce in \nmost organizations, and because much of the research \nimplies that Intuitives deal better with change, practitioners \nneed to have the context and information provided by \nClancy in interpreting and using this research. MBTI practi- \ntioners dealing with changing organizations note that all \ntypes will resist change if they are not informed and \nincluded. All types will struggle in making needed changes \nif their needs are not met by the organization. \n\nSummary \n\nHelping organizations and employees deal with ongoing \nchange may be the organizational development specialists \ngreatest challenge. Integrating MBTI type knowledge and \nperspectives into change programs has proven invaluable \nto individual employees and leaders and to the organization. \n\nRecognizing and Managing Stress \n\nStress is an integral and perhaps inevitable part of organiza- \ntional life. Organizations place multiple, sometimes contra- \ndictory, and often rapidly changing demands on all person- \nnel. The variety and continuity of stressors in the workplace \nprovide a *living laboratory\" for recognizing the distinctive \nways in which people of each of the 16 types experience and \nreact to stress.

Stress man- \nagement has obvious benefits in increased work output, \nfewer sick days due to stress-related illnesses, decreased \nemployee burnout and job turnover, and other benefits that \nresult from greater employee comfort and satisfaction. \n\nThere are two relevant areas in exploring organizational \nstress in relation to psychological type. The first refers to \nthe particular work situations that each type finds espe- \ncially stressful and the second to the ways each type tends \nto react to such stress. Both the sources of stress for each \ntype and the responses to stress are predictable from type \ntheory. Because the theory is based on thc different \namounts of energy each type has available for different \nkind of activities, we can observe the effects of these energy \ndifferences for each dichotomy as well as at the level of \nwhole types. The next section focuses on stress issues for \neach dichotomy. \n\nThe MBTI Dichotomies \n\nPeople tend to be energized when using their preferences \nand fatigued when using their less preferred functions and \nattitudes. Energy depletion, in addition to the dissatisfac- \ntion of doing things that dont come naturally, is an obvi- \nous way to cause stress. For example, Introverts are likely to \n[eel energized when left alone to complete a project, while \nExtraverts may find this stressful and fatiguing. People who \nprefer Sensing find carefully checking the facts of a report to \nbe satisfying while those who prefer Intuition would likely \nfind this activity tiring and unmotivating. Providing fre- \nquent positive feedback to employees will feel natural and \nsatisfying for a person who prefers Feeling but unnecessary, \nawkward, and draining to many Thinking types.

Managers, team leaders, and \npeople throughout the organization can use the relatively \nstraightforward differences in Table 13.11 to modily their \ndemands and expectations of themselves and others. \n\nA simple and effective approach when one must work \nout of ones opposite preferences (as is often the case) is to \nacknowledge to oneself and/or appropriate others that the \nactivity is \"typologically stressful,\" anticipate that it is likely \nto trigger a typologically predictable\" stress reaction, and \ntry to arrange at least a minimum amount of time for activi- \nties that replenish and reenergize preferred functions and \nattitudes. For example, an Introvert who anticipates with \ndread a weck filled with lengthy daily meetings might plan \nher lunch hours alone in the park; a Feeling type who has \nto spend the week doing employee performance reviews \nmight take extra time giving positive feedback to others. \n\n346 The Uses of Type \n\nDynamic Types \n\nWhat each type finds especially stressful in the workplace \nand typical reactions to stress are understandable and pre- \ndictable from a knowledge of the characteristics of the dom- \ninant function of each type. Both theory and experience \nshow that in general, what each type finds particularly \nstressful are activities and perspectives that disregard the \ncore needs and values of the dominant function and force \nattention to the opposite, infcrior, function. For example, \nESTPs (dominant extraverted Sensing) will likely be stressed \nby having to spend a week working alone on a long-term \nstrategic plan, an activity that requires use of their inferior \nintroverted Intuition. ISFJs (dominant introverted Sensing) \nmight find it stressful to be given a leadership role in a \nrapidly changing department. \n\nTheory and experience also show that the types respond \ndifferently to moderate, short-term stress as compared to \nmore extreme and long-lasting stress. The typical response \nto moderate stress is exaggeration of the dominant func- \ntionan overdoing of our natural reliance on the most com- \nfortable and developed part of our personality. Barger and \nKirby (19952) describe each dominant function as it appears \nat its best as well as in exaggerated form. For example, dom- \ninant extraverted Intuitives (ENTP, ENFP), who by nature \nform global pictures and are fast paced, under moderate \nstress become obsessed with the links between things and \nspin out of control. Dominant extraverted Thinking types \n(EST), ENTJ), who are naturally cool-headed and analytical, \nbecome coldly detached when in an exaggerated state and \ntry to dominate others by criticizing them. The same princi- \nple applies to the dominant function of the other types. \n\nMore extreme and persistent stress is likely to call forth \nout-of-character reactions for each of the types. From a \ndynamic point of view, the exaggerated use of energy of the \ndominant function ereates an imbalance that produces an \nequal but opposite expression of energy from the least \ndeveloped, least experienced, and most uncontrollable \nfunctionthe opposite, inferior, function. For example, an \nESFJ (dominant extraverted Feeling) experiencing extreme \nstress may \"change\" from a congenial, helpful person who \nstrives to affirm others to one who is bitingly critical, nega- \ntive, and sarcastic. An INTP (dominant introverted Think- \ning) under great stress is likely to lose contact with her typi- \ncal objectivity and detachment and become focused entirely \non whether people like and appreciate her as a person. \n\nConsult the resources in this section for publications \nthat provide detailed discussions of the type-related triggers \nto stress and typical responses to and expressions of both \nmoderate and more extreme stress. \n\nThe Advantages of Recognizing Stress \nin the Workplace \n\nType theory and the MBTI provide a rationale for individual \nresponses to stress in the workplace, promote understand- \ning of the sources and naturc of what proves stressful for \n\npeople, and encourage a helpful perspective for assessing \nand dealing with individuals, groups of individuals, and \norganizations under stress. Barger and Kirby (19952) focused \non the kind of stress that accompanies change and transition \nin organizations. They provide information and recommen- \ndations for dealing with change that are based on what is \nstressful for each type during change and what each type \nneeds to make necessary changes as comfortably as possi-",

When people in organizations understand the dynamic \ncharacter of each type, they are generally less surprised, \nangry, anxious, and frustrated by their own and others \nreaction to organizational stress. Acceptance, understand- \ning, tolerance, and a cooperative outlook become possible. \nAt the very least, the ability to recognize the predictability \nof exaggerated and out-of-character reactions puts the \nassessment of such stress-stimulated behavior in perspec- \ntive. Peoples exaggerated and out-of-character responses \nare then less likely to be seen as serious problems or perma- \nnent personality aberrations. \n\nResources \n\nThe Challenge of Change in Organizations (Barger &amp; Kirby, \n1995a) provides a wealth of material on types and their reac- \ntions to the stress of change and transition in todays organi- \nzational climate. Many examples and case studies are pro- \nvided. WORK Types (Kummerow, Barger, &amp; Kirby, 1997) \ndiscusses stress as experienced by each type with examples \nillustrating stress responses. Beside Ourselves: Our Hidden \nPersonality in Everyday Life (Quenk, 1993) gives the rationale \nfor the eruption of the inferior function in response to more \nextreme and long-term stress and provides many examples \nand case studies of individual types as well as the interactions \nof types in personal and work relationships. In addition, a \nconcise presentation of material about the inferior functions \nappcars in the booklet In the Grip (Quenk, 1996), which is \npart of the Introduction to Type series. Also helpful is Work It \nOut: Clues for Solving People Problems at Work (Hirsh with \nKise, 1996), which provides examples of the effects of the \ninferior function on different types in work situations. \n\nResearch for Practitioners \n\nRecent research on type and stress-related physical condi- \ntion, psychological issues, and coping behavior is covered \nin detail in Chapter 10 and summarized and discussed in \ntables 4.44.41 in Chapter +. A detailed review of earlier \nresearch on health, stress, and coping appears in Shelton \n(1996). Of particular interest is research pinpointing the \nnumber and kinds of resources the types report in dealing \nwith stress, as well as evidence that different types are \naffected differently by the environment. Hammer (summa- \nrized in Shelton, 1996) used the Coping Resource Inven- \ntory (CRI) to study type differences in a sample that \nincluded MBA students, residence hall workers, stress man- \nagement program clients, and pain patients.

Just as each of us is \nlikely to evaluate others behavior from the point of view of \nour own type, so are we likely to assume that others cope \nwith stress in ihe same way we do. When this happens, \nwell-meaning efforts to help someone deal with stress can \nbackfire and create even more stress for the individual. For \nexample, suggesting to an ENFJ that he join an athletic club \nand work out every day would not be consistent with the \nlow ranking of physical coping resources for ENFJs. Of \n\ncourse, individual differences within a type might show \nthat a particular ENFJ does in fact use such a coping \nresource. Table 13.12 shows the rankings of resources for \neach type, each types rank as compared to all other types, \nand the ranking of each type on total resources. \n\nThe association of type preferences with different kinds \nof stressful stimuli was explored by Short and Grasha \n(1995) in a sample of managers. They looked at sources ot \nstress, coping strategies, and personality moderator vari- \nables in relation to MBII continuous scores. They found \nthat sensation-seeking, assertiveness, and social hardiness \nwere significantly associated with Extraversion; social stress \nwas associated with Introversion; Thinking was correlated \nwith Type A behavior, assertiveness, and perceptions of \nproblem-solving skills; Judging was related to effective time \nmanagement and Perceiving to sensation-seeking. As a \nresult of a number of different analyses of their data, these \n\n348 The Uses of Type \n\nresearchers concluded that the E-1 dichotomy was the best \npredictor of stress and coping and was also related to per- \nceptions of stress. In addition, they found that results for \nthe other dichotomies were limited to perceptions of coping \nrather than to stress itself. These findings with regard to the \nrelation of Extraversion and Introversion to stress and cop- \ning variables are in accord with the findings of Hammer \ndescribed earlier, as well as with a variety of results reported \nin Chapter 10 and sumunarized in Chapter 4. \n\nUsing the MBTI with Teams \n\nTeams, teamwork, and team building are central concerns \nfor practitioners working with organizations. Hammer and \nHuszczo (1996) reported that a survey of companies by the \nNew York Stock Exchange in 1982 found that more than \n80% of companies use teams for at least some parts of their \nwork, and the use of teams has increased rapidly in the last \nfew vears (Wellins, Byham, &amp; Wilson, 1991; Katzenbach &amp; \nSmith, 1993). \n\nThe practitioners job in working with teams is to facilitate \ntheir working together effectively, and the MBTI has proven to \nbe a valuable tool in meeting this challenge. Myers and \nMcCaulley pioneered the first use of the MBTI as a tool to \nincrease team effectiveness in their work with health care \nteams in 1974 (Myers, 1974). Though type practitioners have \ndeveloped a wide variety of new activities, exercises, and \nresource materials, the basic assumptions underlving using \nthe MBTI with teams remain the same: Knowledge of individ- \nual differences will help teams identify the particular talents \nand gifts that each member brings to his or her task; and this \nknowledge can help reduce conflict by reframing potential \nsources of misunderstanding as natural individual differences. \n\nGuidelines for Using Type with Teams \n\nThe general guidelines for using the MBTI in organizations \n(see section Administering and Interpreting\" at the end of \nthis chapter) apply, and there are some additional ones that \narc especially helpful in working with teams: \n\nB Introduce type and the MBTI with a specific goal, prefer- \nably to deal with a problem the team has identified: \nimprove communication, enhance problem solving, \nteam development, etc. \n\nB As muchas possible, place type and the MBTI within the \ncontext of everyday work. For example, after describing \na preference, practitioners can ask the team to brain- \nstorm ways the behaviors associated with this preference \nwould contribute to teamwork. \n\nB Use the MBTI early on in working with a team, rather \nthan introducing it after conflicts have developed. When \na team is struggling to agree on budgets, division of \ntasks, reporting, or other such issues, introducing the \n\nMBTI to help address the conflict can lead to team mem- \nhers using type as an excuse or to stereotype people: \nYou're an S; you do the budget. \n\nB Introduce type dynamics and development early on in \nyour work with a team.

This deeper level of type is invaluable \nto teams. \n\nB Lead the team in a team type analysis: What preferences \npredominate in the group? Which are missing? What are \nthe dominant functions? How may the distributions \naffect working together? For example, a team consisting \nof.an EST] an ENT], an ENF], an INTP andans F PIRAS \nall dominant Judging types. Recognizing this may lead \nthe team to form agreements around gathering enough \ninformation before rushing to judgment. Likewise, a \nteam consisting primarily of dominant Perceiving types \nmay recognize that members need to push themselves to \nmake decisions in a timely way, before they have all the \ninformation everyone would like to have. \n\nB Provide information to the team about research findings \non type and team effectiveness (see \"Research for Practi- \ntioners at the end of this section). Is there a variety of \ntype perspectives? If not, how can the team integrate \nthose other perspectives into its work? \n\nm When disagreements or conflicts emerge, encourage \nteam members to step back and ask themselves if type \ndifferences are playing a role. Even if they decide they \nare not, the mutual exploration can form the basis for \ndealing with the issues. \n\nNegotiating Working Agreements \n\nTraditionally, people in organizations worked within hierar- \nchical structures, responsible to a superior for getting their \njob completed. Working on teams can produce exciting \nsynergies and collegial support; it also raises issues of loss of \nautonomy, accountability to colleagues, the requirement of \nfrequent communication, and group problem solving. Ne- \ngotiating working agreements among team members is a \ncrucial step in assisting people in learning to work together. \n\nPractitioners can use type in negotiating working agree- \nments. The first step is to generate what each team member \nneeds to be able to contribute his or her best work. \n\nUsing Type Preference Dichotomies Negotiating \nagreements works well at the type preference level when the \nteam is introduced to type: What do those who prefer Ex- \ntraversion need to be able to make a contribution to this \nteam? Those who prefer Introversion? And so on through \nall the preferences. \n\nThe team can then proceed to negotiate around those \nidentified needs. For example, a team can discuss how to \n\nUses of Type in Organizations 349 \n\nplan and conduct meetings to provide what both Extraverts \nand Introverts need and therefore get the best that each has \nto offer: \n\nB Do they need to allow more question and discussion \ntime in the meetings so those who prefer Extraversion \ncan process out loud? \n\nB How far ahead do they need to send out agendas so those \nwho prefer Introversion have time to reflect before hav- \ning to respond? \n\nB How can they ensure that those who prefer Introversion \nwill have space in the meeting to share their thoughts? \n\nTeams with both Sensing and Intuitive types sometimes \ndesignate a time in meetings for each kind of information: \n\"Now its time for Sensing information\"; now its time for \nIntuitive connections and patterns.\" This ensures that peo- \nple with each preference have encouragement to participate \nand that the group will get both kinds of perspectives. \n\nThe guiding value for the group is the constructive use \nof differences the recognition that, for the team to get the \nbenefit of what each member has to offer, it needs to allow \ntime, space, and encouragement for the differences. \n\nUsing Type Dynamics Exploring ways to work together \neffectively can go to even deeper levels by using dynamics \nand/or the four-letter type. An initial way of exploring \ndifferences is to ask team members, individually or with \nothers of the same type, How do you define team? \nTypically, basic definitions of what a team is and does reveal \nvery clear type-related differences: E and F types usually \ndefine teams in terms of interactions and communication; F \ntypes usually mention collegiality and support; T types \ntypically focus on tasks, effectiveness, and efficiency; and so \non. This activity can lead to very profitable discussions of \nteam members' expectations of each other. \n\nAnother activity that frequently produces valuable infor- \nmation for team members is asking individuals or team \nmembers of the same type to respond to questions such as \nthe following: What does our type contribute to our team? \nWhat may our type overdo and overlook? What does our \ntype need to do our best work? What annoys our type? \nAfter hearing from everyone on the team, members can \nexplore what they can do to get the benefit of the contribu- \ntions and to help out in each others weaker areas. \n\nWhen Team Members Don't \nGive the \"Right\" Answers \n\nPractitioners sometimes worry that asking team members \nfor such information by preference or by type may not",

    "content": "produce the right answers; that is, they may not say \nwhat the research or type theory predicts they will say. \nThere are a couple of ways to think about this that are \nreassuring. \n\nFirst, when people have had a good introduction to type \nand an opportunity to verify their own type preferences, \n\nthey are almost always able to apply the information to \ndescribe themselves at work. When people have verified \ntheir type but state that they are different from the de- \nscription in a number of ways, it gives practitioners the \nopportunity to repeat a principle that needs repeating: \nType does not explain everything. Every individual is \nunique, and while type may identify some underlying pat- \nterns, the ways in which those have been used and devel- \noped vary widely from person to person. Though type pre- \ndicts group behavior (see Chapter 9 for a lot of evidence \nabout this), it cannot confidently predict specific behav- \niors of any individual in every situation. Practitioners will \nbe true to type theory when they respond by saying some- \nthing like, So this is the way you personally express your \npreference for Extraversion, and it sounds as though it's \nsomewhat different from the ways others may express that \nsame preference.\" \n\nSecond, even if an individual gives information that \ndoesn't relate to type, it does relate to that individual and \ntherefore is valuable to team members. Types identification \nand affirmation of natural, normal differences among peo- \nple often supports individuals in articulating individual \nneeds. Team activities such as those described provide \nstructure and encouragement for team members to ask for \nwhat they needwhether its type related or not. \n\nMaking Decisions \n\nFew employees have been taught processes for making \ndecisions as a group. The type decision-making model \ndescribed in an earlier section of this chapter is very helpful \nfor teams and can provide a structure for discussion and \ndeciding. It can also be quickly expanded to provide a \nstructure based on type preference: \n\nE: Share information and discuss. \nI: Reflect and then talk. \nS: Identify facts and realities. \nN: Generate possibilities. \nT: Analyze by likely outcomes. \nF: Evaluate by values and relationships. \nJ: Make a plan. \nP: Be open to changing the plan. \nThe ethic and perspective is the same as with othcr type dis- \n\ncussions: Decisions will be stronger if all the perspectives \nare included. \n\nUsing a Team Type Analysis \n\nPsychological type describes individual personality, and this \nneeds to be explicitly recognized when discussing team \ntype. Used with this caution, however, analysis of team \nmembers types and the ways they may characterize the \ngroup can provide a valuable tool for analyzing where the \nteam is effective and where it can improve. \n\n350 The Uses of Type \n\nLooking at preference distributions or at a team type \ntable, for example, allows practitioners to raise questions \nabout the internal working of the team: How do you deal \nwith the Sensing-Intuition differences in the group? Do \nvour plans have enough flexibility for your Perceiving types? \n\nIt can also lcad to profitable discussions about external \nrclationshipswith supervisors or interacting with other \nteams: With our team prelerence for Introversion, do we \ngive enough information, often enough, for those outside \nthe team? \n\nThe issue of team type similarity or diflerence is impor- \ntant to explore with the group. The research on type and \ntcams (sec \"Research for Practitioners\" in this section) indi- \ncates that teams consisting of individuals with similar com- \nmunication styles work together more easily and may arrive \nat decisions more quickly. Teams with differing communi- \ncation styles take more time to make decisions but may pro- \nduce outcomes of better quality. \n\nType Is Not an Appropriate Tool \nfor Selection to Teams \n\nNeither the team nor practitioners should use MBTI results \nto select team members. This is because the MBTI was \ndesigned to assist people in identifying their psychological \ntype preferences. It was not designed to indicate how well \nan individual uses preferences, the skills a person has devel- \noped rclated to type preferences, or other skills related to \nnonpreferred arcas. \n\nThe crucial question for the team and practitioner is, given our \ntype distributions, how can we make the best use of each team \nmember and our type knowledge to be as effective as possible? \n\nIt is not unusual on small teams to find that members \nhave a lot of type similarity and therefore may be missing \nsome of the benefits of diverse perspectives. The question \nto pursue with teams with type similarity is, How can we \ninclude other perspectives? \n\nWhen team members have a lot of type differences, it \nmay be reassuring to them to know that, if they can learn to \nuse their differences, they can function very effectively. \n\nOther Team Relationship Issues \n\nThe other primary team relationship issue practitioners are",

They can use their type description and that of other \nteam members to discuss issues in communication, feedback, \nappreciation, and other topics of importance to the group. \n\nResources \n\nIts important to start with Introduction to Type (Myers, with \nKirby &amp; Myers, 1998) and individual type verification.

Hammer and Huszezo ask if teams are fully \nutilizing Introversion. \n\nSimilarity and Difference in Team Communication Styles \n\nHammer and Huszezo reported results of several studies \nanalyzing similarities and differences among team \nmembers. The studies that may be of most interest to team \nmembers and practitioners take the following approach: \nUsing intact work teams, researchers determine the type of \neach individual on the team, compute a \"similarity index,\" \nand then correlate the index with various measures of \nprocess and outcomes. \n\nFor example, Hammer and Huszezo reported on studies \nusing the Team Communication Adjustment Index (TCAD,  \ntool that identifies communication styles and is consistent \nwith type theory. Their analysis and summary of these stud- \nies is presented in Table 13.13. \n\nIn brief, they found the following: \n\nTeams with similar communication styles \nB Perform their tasks more quickly \nB Experience less conflict \n\nB Like each other more \nB Listen to one another more \n\nTeams with diverse communication styles \nB Are more effective \n\nB Produce better outcomes \n\nB May take more time \n\nTeam Leaders surveying the rescarch in this area, Hammer \nand Huszezo concluded that MBTI preferences were pre- \ndietors of values related to leader-member interactions and \nsatisfaction: \n\nB Managers or leaders with MBTI preferences for E and F \nwere generally rated higher on teamwork variables. \n\n@ Managers or leaders with NTP preferences, especially \nINTP. were found to value self-oriented individualism, a \nvalue that research on teams indicates interferes with \nteamwork. \n\nB Leaders who were different in type from the team, espe- \ncially on the Thinking-Fecling dichotomy, were rated by \nteam members as more elfective than leaders who were \nthe same as the team. \n\nB In a study of participative management, all types were \nable to learn the needed skills, but Feeling types were \nmore able to use the participative leadership style. \n\n352 The Uses of Type \n\nSummary \n\nBecause the MBTI focuses on seH-understanding, under- \nstanding others, and appreciation of differences, it is a valu- \nable tool in working with teams. Integrating the MBTI into \nteam interactions, agreements, communication, and deci- \nsion making provides a language and a structure for creat- \ning teams that adds value for team members and for the \norganization. \n\nUsing the MBTI in Leadership \nDevelopment and Coaching \n\nLeadership development, management training, coaching \nexecutivesby whatever name, this is one of the fastest \ngrowing areas in organizational development activity. Con- \nsulting Psychology Journal (Kilburg, 1996) published a spe- \ncial edition on executive coaching; leadership institutes are \npresenting entire conferences focusing on executive coach- \ning; large organizations such as the Center for Creative \nLcadership have succeeded remarkably, focusing entirely on \nmanagement and leadership development; and the question \nof effective leadership has produced a massive volume of \nliterature. \n\nThe analyses of effective leadership and recommenda- \ntions can be overwhelming to managers and leaders. This \nchapter will not survey the literature on leadership (for this, \nsee Fitzgerald, 19972), but professionals who work in lead- \nership development need to do so and find ways to make the \ninformation manageable and relevant to those with whom \nthey work. Assuming the professionals expertise in leader- \nship, this section focuses on appropriate and beneficial ways \nto use the MBTI! in leadership development activities. \n\nUse of the MBTI in Leadership Development \n\nAccording to Fitzgerald (1997b), The Myers-Briggs Type",

    "content": "Indicator (MBTI) has become a kcy resource in leadership \ndevelopment and is widely used in leadership development \nraining and executive coaching\" (p. 311). One of the \nlargest sources of data on managers, leaders, and leadership \ndevelopment is the Center for Creative Leadership, which \nhas used the MBTI and psychological typc with its partici- \npants in group and individual work since 1982. \n\nFitzgerald (1997b) also pointed out the limitations of the \nways the MBTI is used by most professionals in this area by \ndefining three levels of usc (p. 311): level 1, which uses the \ntype dichotomies; level 2, which introduces and uses type \ndynamics; and level 3, which uses the type development \nmodel. Type dynamics and development have been largely \nuntapped in leadership development work and offer power- \nful potentials for increasing leader effectiveness and growth. \n\nAll of the earlicr sections in this chapter offer information \nthat can be readily applied to using the MBTI in leadership \n\ndevelopment: improving communication, dealing with \nconflicts, enhancing problem solving and decision making, \ndealing with organizational change, managing stress, and \nusing the MBTI with teams. Placed in the leadership con- \ntext, these all provide valuable information for leaders and \npractical applications for prolessionals working with them. \nThis chapter will focus primarily on what Fitzgerald terms \nlevels 2 and 3: using type dynamics and development with \nleaders. \n\nThinkingJudging Leadership Styles \n\nThe overrepresentation of managers who prefer the combi- \nnation of Thinking and Judging on the MBTI is well docu- \nmented in a wide varicty of studies and in data from a wide \nvariety of cultures (Reynierse, 1997; Fleenor, 1997; Kirby, \n1997; Fitzgerald &amp; Kirby, 1997b). Kirby suggested the fol- \nlowing explanation: \n\nThe structure and values of organizations seein to have favored \nthe logical and decisive behaviors most comfortable to those \npreferring Thinking and Judging, but that are less natural or \ncomfortable to the three other comparable combinations of \npreferencesFeeling and Judging, Feeling and Perceiving, and \nThinking and Perceiving. Because Thinking and Judging types \nare so prevalent in organizational leadership, it may be that \nThinking and Judging behaviors have become the accepted defi- \nnition of what it means to lead, and, therefore, people displaying \nthese behaviors are seen as leadership material. Other styles of \nleading may then not be seen as leadership because they do \nnot fit the standard definition. (Kirby, 1997, p. 18) \n\nThe Challenges This Presents Whatever the causes for this \n\nphenomenon, professionals working in leadership de- \nvelopment will usually find themselves interacting with a \nmajority of TJs. The challenge for practitioners is to \nunderstand and support the natural style and developed \nskills of T] leaders while assisting them in seeing the \nbencfits of modifying those skills and that style. \n\nThe corollary to the preponderance of TJs in manage- \nment is that managers with different combinations of prel- \nerences normally will have developed a number of skills \nand behaviors related to Thinking and Judging. With such \nTJ skills encouraged and supported by their environment, \nthey may not have valued or developed their own natural \nstyle of leadership. According to type theory, people arc \nmost effective when they have developed their own natural \nstyle and then learned to use nonprelferred areas as appro- \npriate. For some leaders who are not TJs, this development \nof their natural way of leading may not have occurred, as \nthe organizational cultures in which they have worked and \nsucceeded may not have supported such development. \n\nThinkingJudging Strengths and Weaknesses as Leaders \nResearch and practice (Barger &amp; Kirby, 19952) have iden- \ntified a number of components of TJ leadership style. lt is \nimportant to remember that these are characteristics of \ngroups of TJs, and individual leaders with those preferences \nmay vary on any number of these qualities and behaviors. \n\nStrengths in leadership associated with ThinkingJudging: \n\nW Focus on creating logical order and structures in the \norganization and its processes \n\nW Focus on achieving organizational goals \n\nB Use logical reasoning to quickly analyze problems \n\nB Are decisivemake decisions quickly and with confi- \ndence \n\nm Move to implement decisions quickly and with confi- \ndence \n\nB Emphasize efficiency \n\nm Value competence, set high standards lor themselves and \nothers \n\nThey may give less attention and energy to, and therefore be \nless skilled in, some other behaviors that contribute to \neffective managing and leading. \n\nWeaknesses in leadership associated with Thinking- \n\nJudging: \n\nm Creating logical structures that unintentionally limit \nothers flexibility, creativity, and perspectives \n\nB Emphasizing efficiency over inclusion and consultation \nfailing to involve others in analysis and decision making",

Thinking-Judging leaders highly value being \ncompetent and effective. Using the MBTI allows practition- \ners to alfirm their competence and effectiveness while help- \ning them identify areas where they can improve. \n\nEmphasizing Process, Inclusion, and Flexibility One of the \nhardest tasks for Thinking managers, especially those who \ncombine Thinking with Extraversion, is recognizing the \nprocess and inclusion needs of others and finding ways to \nsupport those. Using type can help identify others' needs for \nprocess and inclusion. Thinking types will be particularly \nreceptive to this information if it comes from a respected \ncolleague, someone whose leadership abilities they \nrecognize and who can express these needs in terms of his \nor her own natural style. \n\nAnother effective vehicle for communicating these needs \nto leaders is using other instruments to provide practical, \n\n353 \n\nUses of Type in Organizations \n\nspecific feedback about their style and its impacts. A varicty \nof 360-degree feedback instruments can serve this purpose \n(Van Velsor &amp; Fleenor, 1997; Fleenor, 1997), giving leaders \nspecific information related to their effectiveness or lack of \neffectiveness. Practitioners can also make use of informa- \ntion from the Leadership Styles Inventory (LSD and the CPI \n(Pearman &amp; Fleenor, 1996; Fleenor, 1997), and Systematic \nMultiple-Level Observation of Groups (SYMLOG; Sundstrom \n&amp; Busby, 1997) in identifying common strengths and weak- \nnesses in leadership by type. \n\nThe information provided by looking at other instru- \nments enables practitioners to appreciate some of the \nnuances that make whole dynamic types different from one \nanother. For example, Table 13.14 presents type data in rela- \ntion to the 20 CPI Folk Concept Scales. The table shows the \ntypes whose mean score was significantly higher or lower \nthan the total sample mean on each scale. Because the sam- \nple size was large (15,102 participants in Center for Creative \nLeadership training programs), only mean differences signif- \nicant at p  .001 are shown. In interpreting these data, it is \nimportant to bear in mind that scores on the CPI scales for \nall types represent variations within the normal range of each \nscale. The meaning of high and low scores is shown in the \ntable to discourage misunderstanding of some of the scale \nnames. Note, for example, that although a number of scales \nseem to dilferentiate between types preferring Extraversion \nand thosc preferring Introversion, there are Extraverted and \nIntroverted types that dont appear with the other types with \nthe same attitude. One can thus explore some of the subtle \ndifferences in the way a persons whole type differently \nalfects the behavior encompassed by a particular CPI scale. \nNote that these same CPI data are presented for each type in \nChapter +, Tables 4.264.41, and are also discussed in Chap- \nter 9 as evidence of the validity of whole type. \n\nResearch from the national sample correlating the Emo- \ntion Quotient Inventory (ECH) with MBTI results may also \nprovide useful feedback. The small sample size (N = 139) \nsupported only a correlational analysis in relation to the \nfour dichotomies. Results are reported below. \n\nB Extraversion was found to correlate (p values significant \nat .001) with the following EQI scales: \nAssertiveness \nEmotionality \nEmpathy \nFlexibility \nHappiness \nInterpersonal Relations \nOptimism \nSelf-Actualization \nSclf-Regulation \nTotal Adaptability \nTotal Emotion Quotient Index \nGeneral Mood \nTotal Interpersonal \nTotal Stress Management \n\n354 \n\nThe Uses of Type \n\nTable 13.14 Higher and Lower Scoring Types on the 20 Folk Concept Scales of the CPI \n\nKind of Measure, Scale Name, Meaning of Higher and Lower Scores \n\nPoise, Self-Assurance, Interpersanal Proclivities Scales \n\nDominance (Do) \n\nCapacity for Status (Cs) \n\nSociability (Sy) \n\nSocial Presence (Sp) \n\nSelf-Acceptance (Sa) \n\nIndependence (In) \n\nEmpathy (Em) \n\n \n\nHigher: \nLower: \n\nHigher: \nLower: \n\nHigher: \nLawer: \n\nHigher: \nLower: \n\nHigher: \n\nLower: \n\nHigher: \n\nLower: \n\nHigher: \n\nLower: \n\n P P \n\nconfident, assertive, dominant, task oriented",

Within this context they will respond \nquickly to learn active listening, ways to acknowledge the \ncontributions of others, how to give positive feedback, and \nSO on. \n\nlts important to emphasize with clients that these new \nskills will add positive dimensions to skills already devel- \noped, not change them into a different kind of person, and \nthat they need to continue to be authentic in their leadership. \n\nOther Leadership Styles \n\nSimilar steps can be followed in working with TP, FJ, and \nFP leaders. In these cases, professionals may also want to \nexplore where and how these leaders have been able to \ndevelop their own natural strengths. If these strengths \nhave not been supported, working together to identify \ntheir benefits to the organization and avenues for using \nthem can be very profitable in the leaders development \nand confidence. \n\nCoaching Individuals \n\nAll of the information above can be used in coaching indi- \nviduals. One effective approach is to use this information \ncarly on in the coaching relationship, as part of building the \ntrust necessary for effective coaching. Professionals can \nlead clients through a process of identifying client leader- \nship strengths related to type and then can work with the \nclient to examine differences between that and the profes- \nsionals own type-related strengths. Coach and client can \nthen negotiate around their differences using questions \nsuch as these: What is important to you in our relation- \nship? What behaviors on my part will respect and honor \nwhat's important to you? Which of my strengths would \nyou like to know more about? Will you help me learn \nmore about some of your specific strengths? The process \nmust of course remain focused on the client, rather than \nthe practitioner. \n\nUsing this approach encourages a climate of mutual \nrespect and trust while assisting leaders in analyzing their \nown style. It also models appreciation and negotiation of \ndifferences, valuable components of leadership. \n\nUsing Type Dynamics",

    "content": "Using the TJ, TP. FJ, and FP combinations in the beginning \nwith leaders is very effective: The applications and the value \nol the information and process are readily apparent. Because \n\nthese combinations include the J-P dichotomy, this approach \nleads naturally into explaining type dynamics (sce the earlier \nsection in this chapter \"Introducing and Using the Dynamic \nand Developmental Aspects of Type). \n\nUsing type dynamics with leaders provides the following \nbenefits (Fitzgerald &amp; Kirby, 1997a): \n\nl. It clarifies the relationship between a leaders inner pro- \ncessing and outward functioning. Because leaders must \noperate so much in the Extraverted world, they, as well \nas their followers, may fail to recognize and appreci- \nate their Introverted parts. This can be particularly \nimportant for leaders who prefer Introversion and \ntherefore use their dominant function internally, but \nits also important for those who prefer Extraversion. \n\nFor example, ENT] leaders may customarily interact \nwith colleagues and subordinates in ways appropriate \nand consistent with their dominant extraverted Think- \ning. They may fail to make others aware of their inter- \nnal Intuitive processing and give others the impression \nthat they are all judgment, no information. \n\n2. It provides a basis for analyzing the relationship between \na leaders perception and judgment. Which function is \ndominant? Is the auxiliary function well developed? \nDoes it provide the balance that will produce the \nmost effective leadership? \n\nFor example, EST] leaders may recognize that \ntheir drive for achieving goals efficiently may some- \ntimes lead them to spend too little time consulting \ntheir introverted Sensing auxiliaryespecially in fast- \npaced environments requiring quick decisions and \nactions. \n\n3. It can inerease leaders sclf-understanding and their \nrccognition of the impacts they have on their followers. \nFor example, INFP Jeaders can recognize that their \nmost important parttheir central core of values \nby which they evaluate everythingseldom gets \nexpressed as they use their auxiliary extraverted Intu- \nition to perform effectively as a leader. The part that is \nmost important to INFPstheir introverted Feeling \nis often not known to followers, who can find the \nleader difficult to understand and feel puzzled about \nhow to meet the leaders expectations. This recogni- \ntion can lead to explorations of ways INFPs can com- \nmunicate these personal values effectively to those \nthey lead. \n\n4. It suggcsts specific target arcas for developing additional \nleadership skills and some stratcgies for beginning. For \nexample, ISTJ leaders may recognize and appreciate \nthe leadership skills exhibited by those who naturally \nextravert Fecling judgment. Examination of common \ncharacteristics of Extraverted Feeling types can pro- \nvide practical goals for ISTJ development. \n\n5. It gives a structure for understanding some of the \nimpacts of stress on leadcrship stylc. For example, \n\nENF] leaders may recognize that, under stress, they \ntend to exaggerate their dominant extraverted Feel- \ning to the point of great annoyance to others (sec sec- \ntion Managing Stress\" earlier in this chapter). They \nmay focus on finding consensus and harmony when \nits time to move on and may be intrusive in their \ninsistence on helping others. Recognizing these \nstress-related behaviors is the first step in learning to \ndeal more effectively with the stresses faced hy all \nleaders. \n\nUsing Type Development with Leaders \n\nType development adds another dimension to leadership \ndevelopment, offering rewards in personal understanding \nand development as well as growth as a leader. Jungs \ndevelopmental model, described in Chapter 3 of this man- \nual, can be communicated quickly to leaders and then \noffers the following opportunities for leadership and per- \nsonal development: \n\nm Analyzing development of the dominant and auxiliary \nfunctions: How have individuals used these preferred \nareas? Where in their work and personal life have they \nfound encouragement and support for their develop- \nment and use? Can they identify areas in their current \nand future work life where they ean effeetively apply \nthese? \n\nm Evaluating their balancebetween Extraversion and \nIniroversion and between perception and judgment: \nHave they developed effective ways of being in the world \nand drawing on inner resources? Do they have reliable, \ntrustworthy ways of taking in information and of mak- \ning decisions? Has the press of family, culture, work, or \nother environmental factors led to a lack of development \nin one of their preferred areas? \n\nm Exploring the possibilities of midlife development: What \nis midlife? How do different types experience it? What \nissues does it present for leaders?

The developmental model \nassists them in seeing that these are not puzzling individual \nweaknesses or confusing symptoms but instead a natural \ndevelopment that ean produce beneficial results. \n\n357 \n\nUses of Type in Organizations \n\nGuidelines for Using Type Dynamics \nand Development with Leaders \n\nFitzgerald (1997b) and Fitzgerald &amp; Kirby (1997a) offer \nsuggestions for using dynamics and development in leader- \nship development and executive coaching. The following is \na brief summary: \n\nm Analyze the impact of the function that is extraverted. \nFor example, leaders who extravert Thinking may need \nto hear the impact their logical dissection of problems \ncan have on others and explore ways to provide more \npositive feedback. \n\nm Analyze the impact of the function that is introverted. \nFor example, leaders who introvert their perceiving \nfunction may want to learn how to give others the \ninformation they have inside that has guided their \nExtraverted decisions. \n\n@ Explore the relative emphasis on perception versus judg- \nment. For example, leaders who prefer Judging may \nwant to develop ways to feel comfortable putting off \ndecisions while more information is gathered; those who \nprefer Perceiving may need to develop comfort in some- \ntimes making decisions without perfect information. \n\nm Explore the relative emphasis on the outer world, \nextraverting, versus the inner world, introverting. For \nexample, leaders may find that the fast pace and de- \nmands of their environment have resulted in their not \ngiving their Introverted part an opportunity to play a \nrole. Whether that is their perceiving function or their \njudging function, they will be missing some of their own \nimportant strengths if they have not found time and \nspace for their Introversion to play a role. \n\nm Contrast leaders type dynamics with those of colleagues \nor subordinates. For example, exploring what each \nextraverts and introverts can illuminate long-standing \nmisunderstandings and provide new ways for them to \nconnect. \n\ngm Explore the impacts of leaders tertiary and inferior func- \ntions. For example, have Sensing leaders learned to use \nand trust their Intuition when that is appropriate? Have \nThinking leaders learned to listen to their Fecling? \n\n Give opportunities to discuss leaders inferior functions, \nespecially ways in which it may function as their \nAchilles heel. For example, are there some things they \nalways overlook? Are there some areas where they never \nseem to learn from experience? \n\nm Discuss emergence of the nonpreferred functions at \nmidlife and beyond. For example, for a dominant \nextraverted Intuitive, what does emerging introverted \nSensing look like? \n\nm Analyze leaders environments and demands in terms of \ncurrent and potential use of their strengths and opportu- \nnities for development. For example, can a dominant \n\n358 The Uses of Type \n\nFeeling type find areas at work to contribute. the \nstrengths of that function? \n\njungs concept of lifelong growth is extremely appealing \nto clients. For many, it opens up exciting opportunities per- \nsonally and professionally. Fitzgerald chapter (1997b) on \nusing type development with leaders is subtitled Integrat- \ning Reality and Vision, Mind and Heart. The subtitle de- \nscribes what leaders need to be more effective. \n\nResources \n\nThe recommended resource lor introducing type is Intro- \nduction to Type (Myers, with Kirby &amp; Myers, 1998). Using \nthis booklet keeps the initial focus where it needs to be: \nidentifying leaders type apart from their work and the roles \nthey play. Introduction to Type in Organizations (Hirsh &amp; \nKummerow, 1998) provides type descriptions that relate \nspecifically to work and include each types normal leader- \nship style. Introduction to Type Dynamics and Development \n(Myers &amp; Kirby, 1994) provides the basis for using dynam- \nies and development with leaders, including information \nthat will be helpful in all the suggested applications above. \n\nHardwired Leadership (Pearman, 1998) provides insights \ninto personality style and shows how to enhance your lead- \nership style to increase personal and work effectiveness and \ntransform group efforts into meaningful results. \n\nDeveloping Leaders (Fitzgerald &amp; Kirby, 1997b) includes \nan introduction to the MBTI and discussion of the impacts of \nMBTI types of leaders (Chapter 1); an analysis of the MBTI \nand leadership development, including a survey of the litera- \nture on leadership (Chapter 2); a chapter on using type \ndynamics with leaders and another on using type develop-",

Barr and Barr (1994) integrate the MBTI \ninto their Leadership Development: Maturity and Power, pro- \nviding descriptions, analysis, and development activities. \n\nResearch for Practitioners \n\nThe research literature on the MBTI and managemenvlead- \nership is extensive and can be overwhelmingto practi- \ntioners as well as their clients. Walck has published three \nsurveys and analyses of research in this area: \"Psychologi- \ncal Type and Management Research: A Review (1992); \n\"Management and Leadership\" (1996); and \"Using the \nMBTI in Management and Leadership: A Review of the Lit- \ncraturc\" (1997). Each of these has extensive references to \nliterature anc will provide a useful starting point for practi- \ntioners to identify researeh findings that will be relevant in \ntheir work. \n\nUsing the MBTI with Other Instruments Most leadership \ndevelopment prograins and coaching interactions involve use \nof more than one instrument for providing feedback to \nleaders. This is appropriate: Different instruments are de- \nsigned to identify a variety of characteristics and behaviors \nimportant to leaders, and use of instruments looking at \ndifferent aspects adds value for leaders. \n\nIt is important for professionals to assist leaders in inte- \ngrating this information (Fleenor, 1997). In using the MBTI \nwith other instruments, practitioners need to explore \nresearch studies relating the MBTI to those other instru- \nments and be prepared to give concise information to \nclients that will assist them in making use of the infor- \nmation, rather than being overwhelmed by sometimes \nconflicting data. Developing Leaders (Fitzgerald &amp; Kirby, \n1997b) includes six chapters reporting research using the \nMBTI with leaders, including the relationship between the \nMBTI and several 360-degree feedback instruments and \nother measures of leadership. 1t also includes a model for \nusing two instruments together in Schnel] and Hammer, \n\"Integrating the FIRO-B with the MBTI: Relationships, \nCase Examples, and Interpretation Strategies.\" The Journal \nof Psychological Iype is the other primary source for reports \nol studies on the MBTI and other instruments. Practitioners \nare urged to consult these resources to assist their use of the \nMBTI with other instruments, as well as to expand their \nunderstanding of common effects of the MBTI preferences \nin management styles and behaviors. \n\nUsing Type in Analyzing \nOrganizations \n\nPsychological type describes individual personality struc- \ntures; therefore application of type categories to groups \nsuch as teams, organizations, and cultures must always pro- \nceed with caution, and practitioners cannot assume that \nknowledge of a particular types dynamics can be trans- \nferred directly to the dynamics of groups. \n\nWith that caveat, type can play a useful part in analyzing \norganizations and providing valuable information about orga- \nnizational culture and presses on individuals in the organiza- \ntional environment. The concept of environmental press \n(Brehm &amp; Kassin, 1993) states that, at some point, groups \nhave enough uniform behaviors, attitudes, and values that \ngroup members are expected to conform. Applied to organi- \nzations, it is similar to the more familiar concept of organiza- \ntional cultures that, like other cultures, identify appropriate \nbehavior, manners, dress, values, and so on. \n\nAnalyzing Organizational Character \n\nWilliam Bridges (1992a) developed an approach to analyz- \ning the character of organizations\" using Jungian type cat- \negories and the type dichotomies of the MBTI. He is careful \n\nto point out that simply adding together the number of peo- \nple with eaeh type preference to determine whieh are in the \nmajority does not indicate an organizations character (a \nposition supported by comparing type distributions in \nnational samples to analvses of cultural values). Instead, he \ndescribes organizational values and behavior related 10 each \nof the preferences. Extraverted organizations, for example, \nare oriented to the market, allow access to decision making, \nand act quickly, whereas Introverted organizations are ori- \nented toward their internal culture and technology, restrict \naccess to decision making, and respond only after careful \nstudy. Bridges also describes the 16 types of organizational \ncharacter\" and then examines how organizational character \naffects the ways in which organizations respond to change, \ngrowth, and development. \n\nGroups or individuals who have becn introduced to type",

Practition- \ners can take advantage of these spontaneous connections \nclients make by structuring an activity analyzing the organi- \nzations character. Groups can then identify what opportuni- \nties the organization may be missing, difficulties the organi- \nzation may experience, and so on. They can also profitably \ndiscuss the ways the character of the organization may affect \nemployees, especially those who have type preferences differ- \nent from those supported by organizational values and \nbehavior. \n\nAnalyzing Organizational Type Distributions \n\nA different, but related, use of type for organizational analy- \nsis involves collecting data about type distributions in dif- \nferent functions or levels of the organization. Though indi- \nvidual type results cannot be shared, grouped data such as \ntype distributions can, with clients permission, be used to \ncreate type tables of different functions. This information \ncan then be used in a variety of ways to help the organiza- \ntion and individuals within it. \n\nFor example, Barger (personal communication, 1995) \nreported using the MBTI with a company that designed, built, \nand sold houses. Serious conflicts arose between the sales \nagents and the construction crews, and Barger was asked to \nnegotiate what had become an explosive situation. Because \nshe had used the MBTI with both groups, she was able to \nidentify significant type differences: The sales agents were pri- \nmarily ENPs and had identified their work in those terms. \nThe construction supervisors were predominantly ISTJs and \nhad related those type preferences to their group. As in the \nexample earlier in this chapter, in Using Type as a Bridge in \nDealing with Other Conflicts, beginning with analysis of \ngroup type differences immediately depersonalized a number \nof the hottest issues and created a climate in the groups that \nallowed them to negouate other important issues. \n\nPearman (1993) reported another use of type distribu- \ntion information that can be very helpful to organizations: \n\nUses of Type in Organizauons 359 \n\ncomparing type distributions of different levels. In working \nwith supervisors, managers, and executives of a multi- \nnational manufacturing organization, Pearman collected \ntype data about each group and a group designated by the \ncompanv as \"future managers.\" He used self-selection ratios \nto determine types that were over- and underrepresented in \nhigher levels of management, compared to their presence in \nthe lower-level groups. The primary type-related pattern he \nfound indicated that Intuitive types were significantly more \nlikely to be promoted to higher levels of responsibility than \nwere Sensing types. Pearman presented his analysis to the \nexeculive management group and led them through an \nexamination and revision of hiring and promotion policies \nand practices. \n\nResources \n\nBridges (1992a) The Character of Organizations is the only \nthorough attempt to apply MBTI type to organizations. Ryt- \nting, Ware, and Prince (1994) reported a study of 348 suc- \ncessful moderate-size companies in the service sector, about \nhalf of which were family owned. They compared data on \nthe MBTI type of the chief executive officer of a company \nand the companys character using Bridges (19922) Orga- \nnizational Character Index. The most significant relation- \nship they found was that companies headed by types that \nextravert their Thinking process were rated as more \nExtraverted than companies whose leaders introvert their \nThinking process. These relationships were independent of \nwhether CEOs preferred Extraversion or Introversion, lead- \ning the authors to conclude that introversion of the Think- \ning process may lead employees to feel excluded from deci- \nsion making. \n\nReynierse (1993, 1997), Reynierse and Harker (1995), \nand Oswick and Mahoney (1993) provide various kinds of \nanalysis of type distributions at different levels of organiza- \ntional leadership. Their studies can guide practitioners who \nwish to use this approach to assist organizations in examin- \ning their hiring and promotion practices. \n\nAdministering and Interpreting \nthe MBTI in Organizations \n\nChapters 5 and 6 in this manual provide general guidelines \nfor administering and interpreting the Myers-Briggs Type \nIndicator personality inventory. Professionals using the \nMBTI in organizations need to develop policies and proce- \ndures to ensure that those guidelines will be followed by the \norganizations with which they are working. This includes \nanticipating potential problems created by organizational \ncultures and practiees in general, as well as identifying fac- \ntors within specific organizations that could affect working \nwithin the guidelines. \n\n360 The Uses of Type \n\nThis section addresses issues that commonly arise in",

What are valid uses for the MBTI in organizational \nsettings? \nType information should be used to enhance individ- \nual and group satisfaction rather than to restrict or \nlimit individual or group functioning. This chapter has \noutlined a number of appropriate organizational uses of \nthe Indicator: increasing self-understanding, enhancing \ngroup interactions, improving individual and group \ncffectiveness at work, and providing an ethical context \nand tools for dealing with identified problems. \n\nPeople in organizations contracting for adminis- \ntration and interpretation of the MBTI sometimes \nplan to use the results in inappropriate ways, usually \nbecause they misunderstand the meaning of psycho- \nlogical type and the correct interpretation of MBTI \nresults. This confusion arises because they arc famil- \niar with trait measures, which give information about \npeoples skills, knowledge, or behaviorsfor exam- \nple, the Management Skills Profile, the FIRO-B, the \nCalifornia Psychological Inventory, the Kirton Adapta- \ntion Innovation Inventory, and so on. Trait measures \nvield results that allow organizations to assess an \nindividuals skills, performance, and behaviors in spe- \ncific areas. Insofar as the traits measured relate di- \nrectly to the job and the instrument used is reliable \nand valid, results may be appropriate indicators of an \nindividual's suitability for hiring, promotion, or selee- \ntion for particular jobs and teams. \n\nThe MBTI is not a measure of traits; MBTI results do \nnot indicate intelligence, knowledge, or skills. \n\nThe MBTI is a type-sorting instrument designed to \nindicate underlying patterns in personalities. When \nresearch is conducted on groups who share one or \nmore preferences, there are frequently correlations \nwith specific scales on trait measures; this indicates \n\nP \n\nthat, for many people, acting on their type prefer- \nences leads to predictable patterns in behavior, val- \nues, and motivations. Such research does not indicate \nwhether individuals in these type groups use thc \nbchaviors with skill, whether their values are fully \nconsidered and consciously direct their actions, \nwhether they are well-developed individuals, or \nwhether they enjoy performing certain activities. And \nthe research groups data that may or may not apply to \nspecific individuals. \n\nIt is inappropriate to use the MBTI for hiring, promo- \ntion, or selection. Results on the Indicator simply do not \ngive information that will be helpful in these functions. \n\nlf a manager or group needs a person with well- \ndeveloped skills that frequently relate to a particular \nMBTI preference, they need to use in their decision \nmaking past performance with similar tasks or trait \nmeasures that indicate whether individuals have \nthose skills and use them well. Deciding that a certain \nposition requires a Sensing type, for example, and \nselecting a person who reports Sensing on the MBTI \nfor that position is unfair to Intuitive individuals who \nhave developed Sensing skills and is liable to result in \ndisappointing results for the manager and group. \n\nPractitioners nced to be clear about the meaning of \nMBTI results and be able to identify appropriate and \ninappropriate uses confidently. Chapters 1, 2, and 3 \nin this manual discuss the differences between results \non trait measures and type-sorting instruments more \nfully and can assist practitioners in developing their \nown knowledge and confidence. If they have addi- \ntional questions, practitioners can consult the pub- \nlisher of the MBTI or the ethical guidelines of profes- \nsional organizations such as the Association for \nPsychological Type, the American Counseling Associ- \nation, the American Psychological Association, or \nother groups concerned with appropriate uses of psy- \nchological instruments. \n\nExperienced MBTI practitioners have found it \nhelpful not only to clarify these issues with organiza- \ntional clients but also to include in a letter of agree- \nment their understanding of the purposes for using \nthe MBTI. This section includes suggested contents \nfor a letter of agreement that can help practitioners \nensure their clients usc MBTI results appropriately. \n\n.

Ideally, practitioners \n\ncan conduct interviews with group members before \nadministering the MBTI. This step allows practition- \ners to ensure that clients know that taking the MBTI \nis voluntary, to inform them about the general nature \nof MBTI results, to clarify how results will and will \nnot be used, and to prepare ahead of time to deal with \nissues of authority, trust, and group interactions. \n\nRegardless of whether individual interviews are \npossible, in conversation with the contracting individ- \nual or group practitioners can ask a number of ques- \ntions to ensure voluntary completion of the MBTI: \n\n* How was the decision made to use the MBTI? \n\n* Were group members involved in the decision- \nmaking process? \n\n* What information do group members have about \nthe MBTI and its appropriate uses? \n\n* Do the leader and contracting person understand \nthat each individual may decide whether to com- \nplete the Indicator? \n\n* What consequences do they see if one or more \nindividuals in the group choose not to complete \nthe MBTI? \n\n* Are the leader and group prepared to accept each \nindividuals decision and, if necessary, defend it? \n\n* What questions do they have? \n\nIf practitioners have clarified the leaders and \ngroups position on voluntary participation to their \nsatisfaction but have not had an opportunity to speak \nwith each individual, they can include in a letter to \neach respondent the principle that taking the MBTI is \nvoluntary along with an invitation to contact the \npractitioner with any concerns or issues. This section \nincludes suggested contents for a cover letter to \naccompany MBTI booklets and answer sheets. \n\nPractitioners occasionally find that one or more \nmembers of a group choose not to complete the \nMBTI. This may relate to an individuals previous \nexperience with other instruments; to previous expe- \nrience of poor interpretations or uses of the MBTI; to \npersonal issues with the leader, group, or organiza- \ntion; to concerns about protecting privacy; or to \ngroup trust issues. If possible, practitioners should \nspeak directly with such individuals to clarify their \nissues and respond supportively and informatively. If \nthe issue is trust within the group, the practitioner \nmay decide that that issue needs to be dealt with first, \nbefore the MBTI is used. In a group in which distrust \nabounds, the MBTI is not likely to be useful. \n\nIf, even after supportive clarification, a group member \nchooses not to complete the Indicator, practitioners \nneed to have ways to support that decision. \n\nSuggestions for dealing with reluctant participants \nare included later in this chapter. \n\nUses of Type in Organizations 361 \n\n. How can practitioners ensure that MBTI results \n\nremain confidential? \n\nPractitioners need to clarity how the MBTI will be dis- \ntributed to respondents, how answer sheets will be \nreturned, and where the results will be stored. In orga- \nnizations, MBTI booklets and answer sheets usually \nare distributed by mail or in a group meeting prior to \nthe MBTI interpretation session. When practitioners \nare not administering the MBTI face-to-face, as is \nmost often the case, thev need to include a cover let- \nter for cach participant to accompany the booklet and \nanswer sheet, with instructions for returning the \nmaterials to the practitioner. \n\nMBTI results are returned only to the respondent, \nand results should not be included in an organiza- \ntions files. Practitioners may keep individuals results \n(often useful for follow-up sessions) and should store \nthem in a secure location. \n\nThe information presented later in this section on \ndealing with reluctant participants discusses protect- \ning confidentiality during interpretation sessions. \n\n. Are there special administration issues when using \n\nthe self-scorable Form M in organizations? \n\nPractitioners who wish to use the self-scorable form \nneed to include about 30 minutes to introduce the \nform and have clients complete the Indicator during \nthe session. This needs to be done before explaining \n\nJungs theory, defining the preferences, and giving \n\nexamples. After all participants have completed the \nIndicator, the practitioner should direct clients to set \nthe form aside while they listen to an introduction \nand interpretation of type (see outline of an introduc- \ntory session in this section). \n\nAt the point in the introductory session where \nMBTI results are normally returned, the practitioner \nwill need to lead clients through scoring their own \nanswer sheets, using careful step-by-step instructions \nto minimize errors in scoring. \n\nFinally, the practitioner should instruct partici-",

What should be included in a letter of agreement \n\nwith the contracting group or person? \nAdministration issues can be dealt with most eflec- \ntively by using contracts or letters of understanding \n\n362 The Uses of Type \n\nprior to administration and by providing a cover let- \n\nter to accompany each MBTI question booklet and \n\nanswer sheet.

This is doubly \ntrue when the supervisor, manager, or leader of the group is \n\nparticipating in the session. Ensuring correct administra- \ntion is a practical matter as well as an ethical one: individual \nresults are more likely to be reliable and valid when guide- \nlines for administration are carefully implemented. \n\nQuestions About Interpreting the MBTI \n\nThe general guidelines for providing an interpretation of \nthe MBTI and returning results are thoroughly outlined in \nChapter 6 of this manual.

First, the MBTI is dif- \nferent from most psychological inventories, which are \ntrait measures indicating to what extent people possess \nor display certain behaviors. Organizational clients are \n\nrw \n\ntypically familiar with trait measures and how the \nresults are interpreted. As a type sorter, the MBTI pro- \nvides fundamentally different information, and clients \nneed to understand that before seeing how they came \nout (sce Chapter 1, pages 4-5, and Chapter 2, page 11, \nfor a more complete discussion of the crucial distinc- \ntions between trait and type pictures of personality). \n\nSceond, results on all psychometric instruments \nare estimates or hypotheses based on how an individ- \nual responded to questions at a particular time and \nplace, and this is true for MBTI results. Clients, how- \nevcr, tend to be accustomed to believing in numbers \nthey are hard evidence. Practitioners need to sup- \nport clients in using their own judgment, in assessing \ntheir results on the instrument based on their knowl- \nedge of themselves. Presenting the information listed \nabove and asking clients to self-estimate their type \ngives them the information they need and explicit \nencouragement to process their MBTI results rather \nthan accepting or rejecting them. \n\n. How should MBTI resulis be returned in group \n\nsettings? \n\nAlter following these steps, practitioners have a num- \nber of options for reporting MBTI results to cach indi- \nvidual. Computer scoring of Form M answer sheets \nuses itcm response theory (IRT) scoring, which gives \nthc most accurate estimate of type and provides  \nvaricty of optional computer-generated reports. Report \noptions arc listed in Table 5.2, page 107, and in the \npublishers catalogue. Computer-scoring software is \nalso available. \n\nFrom the practitioners viewpoint, the primary \nlimitation of computer-generated MBTI reports is that \nthey give information about each clients reported type \n(results on the MBTI). Researchers report that about \n2596 of clients disagree with their MBTI results on \none or more of the four dichotomies, with indica- \ntions that the percentage may be higher for those \nwho take the MBTI in a work setting (sce Table 6.1, \npage 116). If computer reports are used, practition- \ners need to provide a process that will allow each \nindividual to receive a computer report of his or her \nchosen best-fit type. \n\nForm M can also be scored by the practitioner \nusing scoring templates, and a self-scorable Form M \nis available. lf practitioners choose thesc scoring \noptions, they can purchase from the publisher forms \nlor reporting MBTI results. A brief report of individ- \nual results, conpled with use of Introduction to Type, \nprovides all the information included in the computer \nreports and gives both bricf and full descriptions of all \n16 types. \n\nWhichever scoring and reporting option a practi- \ntioner chooses, care should be taken to protect confi- \ndentiality of individual results as they are returned. \n\nUses of Type in Organizations 363 \n\n3. How can practitioners assist clients in deciding on \ntheir best-fit type in group settings? \nAlter defining the MBTI preferences, ask clients to \ncombine thc four letters they selected while listening \nto the interpretation. This provides one hypothesis \ntheir self-estimate based on their understanding of \nthemselves, their understanding of what the MBTI is \ndesigned to indicate, and the professionals expertise \nin explaining the type dichotomies. Then return \ntheir MBTI results and tell them this is a second hy- \npothesis, based on how they responded to the Indica- \ntor questions. \n\nIf their two hypotheses agree, clients can go directly \nto their full type description to verily that this is the \nbest fit for them. If their hypotheses disagrec on one or \nmore preferences, practitioners can direct them to use \nthe steps outlined in the Verifying Your Type scction \nin Introduction to Typc. Using the steps and the lan- \nguage thereand ensuring that there is time lor it in \nthe sessionwill provide participants with the oppor- \ntunity to find the type that fits best for them. \n\nPractitioners should provide a variety of relevant \nresourees in addition to the 16 type descriptions; for \nexample, Introduction to Type in Organizations (Hirsh &amp;",

What else needs to be inclnded in an introductory \nsession? \nAs indicated in this chapters section on introducing \nthe MBTI into organizations, introductory sessions \nneed to include opportunities for clients to apply type \nto their work lives. The activities suggested in this \nchapter and in thc resource materials listed allow \nclients to expand their understanding of type, to con- \nfirm their own preferences, and to recognize the value \nof using type in interacting with colleagues. \n\nQuestions About Other Special Concerns \n\nEven with carcful attention to administration and interprc- \ntation guidelines, practitioners using the MBTI in organiza- \ntions can lace a number of potentially difficult ethical \nissues. The most frequent problem areas identified by con- \nsultants are the following: \n\nB Interpretation and misinterpretation of the numerical \nportion of MBTI results \n\nB Ensuring individual confidentiality in group sessions \n\nB Stereotyping of types and bias lor or against certain types \nor preferences \n\nB^ Copyright violations and use of restricted materials by \nnonqualified individuals \n\nThis section suggests ways to respond appropriately to each \nof these issues. \n\n364 \n\ni \n\nThe Uses of Type \n\n. How can practitioners ensure that numerical scores \n\nare interpreted correctly? \n\nNumerical scores need to be presented by their name: \nthe preference clarity index. The number that accom- \npanies each letter indicates how clearly and consis- \ntently clients voted for one of the opposites on a \nparticular dichotomy. These numbers do not indicate \nhow much of this preference domain an individual \npossesses nor how skilled a person may be in using \nthe preference. \n\nHigh numbers indicate that, when forced to choose, the \nclient consistently chose one pole of the dichotomy \nover the other. Low numbers indicate that, when forced \nto choose, the client \"split che vote. \n\nlt is helpful to tell clients that the MBTI is a \nsorter rather than a measuring instrument. The goal \nis to sort respondents into the correct-for-them cat- \negory. The MBTI was not designed to indicate \nstrength, skill, or frequency of behaviors. \n\nIt can also be helpful to explicitly state that MBTI \nresults do not fall on a normal curve, as do results \nfrom most of the instruments with which clients are \nfamiliar. When an instruments results fall on a nor- \nmal curve, there is a normal or average range and \nthere are varying degrees of extreme scores with \nappropriate interpretations. The MBTI does not have \nnorms about where individuals *should come out\"; \nthe only standard of judgment for results is the indi- \nviduals own decision about which pole of a type \ndichotomy best defines his or her own most natural \nway of functioning. \n\n. How can practitioners ensure individual confiden- \n\ntiality in group settings? How can practitioners deal \nwith reluctant participants who do not complete the \nMBTI or who decline to share their type with col- \nleagues? \nPractitioners, leaders, and colleagues may all agree \nwith the ethical principles that taking the MBTI is \nvoluntary and that results belong to the individual; \nhowever, they can feel puzzled about how to support \nthese principles when using the MBTI in work \ngroups. As indicated in the section on administration, \ncareful preparation and the use of a cover letter to \naceompany booklets and answer sheets will normally \nidentify people who are unwilling to take the Indica- \ntor or who have concerns about sharing their type \npreferences during the group session. With this infor- \nmation, practitioners can plan their MBTI sessions to \nensure that using the Indicator does not put individu- \nals on the spot or add 10 a climate of distrust. \nMembers of an intact work group who choose not \nto take the Indicator need to attend the introductory \nsession: all group or team members need to receive \nthe same information and materials about the MBTI. \n\n[hey can participate in the handedness exercise, \nreceive a copy of the materials provided, listen to defi- \nnitions and examples of the preferences, and make a \nself-estimate. \n\nWhen group members engage in activities related \nto their decisions about their types, however, it is wis- \nest to provide the non-MBTI taker with a role such as \nobserver. Practitioners can prepare a simple observer \nassignment ahead of time; for example: Observe the \nprocess and interactions of each gronp and be pre- \npared to tell us about one similarity and one differ- \nence you observed. This gives those who do not \nwant to take the MBTI a real role to play and ensures \nthat their reluctance will not interfere with the \ngroups ability to develop an understanding of type \nand application of the concepts. \n\nThe same observer role can be offered more gener-",

This \nallows those who are not ready to identify their type to \nparticipate in the group and learn from their colleagues. \n\n. How can practitioners deal with bias and stereo- \n\ntyping? \n\nIn some organizational settings, psychological type \nand the MBTI have been introduced in ways that lead \nto stereotyping of individuals and types. People who \nare targets of such categorizing naturally resent it and \noften reject type and the MBTI. Such an outcome of \nan organization development activity obviously does \na disservice to the organization and clients, as well as \nto the MBTI and type theory. \n\nOrganizational type practitioners can avoid such \nmisuses of the MBTI by committing to two comple- \nmentary strategies: (a) developing their own type \nunderstanding, including recognizing and finding \nways to mitigate the inevitable biases that accompany \ntheir own type preferences; and (b) dealing explicitly \nwith bias and stereotyping as part of their introduction \nto type sessions and any additional work using type. \n\nThe MBTI practitioners responsibility is to present \ntype in an unbiased way, using cogent, relevant exam- \nples of the usefulness of the different preferences \nwithin the organizational environment. Following \nthis, practitioners need to present the four-letter types \nas dynamic categories and tendencies. They need to \nemphasize that every successful adult has developed a \nvariety of behaviors and skills in areas that are not \ntheir preferred ones, and that this development, cou- \npled with recognition of ones natural styles, can be a \npositive contribution to work. \n\n. What can help practitioners understand thcir own \n\nbiascs? \n\nTo present an unbiased explanation of type, practi- \ntioners need to understand their own type and how it \nmay affect their presentations. They also need to \nbecome aware of their own natural biases related to \n\ntype. The following professional development actions \n\nassist practitioners in meeting these responsibilities: \n\n* Clarify your own type: What is your type? Your \ndominant function? Your auxiliary function? What \ndoes your type contribute to your work? Where do \nyour type preferences sometimes get in your way? \nWhat is your preferred communication style? How \ndo others experience you as a communicator?

Multicultural Applications in MBTI Ap- \nplications (Kirby &amp; Barger, 1996) summarizes dozens of \narticles by researchers and practitioners using the MBTI in \nnon-U.S. cultures.

Those who desire \n\n367 \n\n368 The Uses of Type \n\nmore complete information on the research should refer to \nthe summaries in Kirby and Barger. \n\nMulticultural and international practitioners use the \nMBTI in a wide variety of waysin fact, in all of the ways \ndiscussed in the chapters in Part V, \"Uses of Type. This \nchapter will not focus on particular applications such as mul- \nticultural counseling or organizational development but \ninstead will discuss the broader core issues important to \npractitioners who want to use the Mycrs-Briggs Type Indica- \ntor with groups and individuals who are culturally different \nfrom those with whom the MBTI was developed and tested. \n\nType and Culture \n\nSocial and cultural anthropologists have developed dozens \nof definitions of culture. One that seems clear and straight- \nforward is provided hy Geert Hofstede (1991) of the Insti- \ntute for Research on Intercultural Cooperation: Culture is \nlearned patterns of thinking, feeling, and acting, or, using \nHofstedes analogy to computers, the software of the mind \n(pp. 4-5). In his definition, Hofstede distinguishes culture \nfrom those parts of human functioning that are genetic and \ncommon to all, which he refers to as the operating system \nof the human mind. Hofstedes diagram of human personal- \nity, Shown in Figure 14.1, outlines these components. \n\nJung, Myers, and Briggs believed that psychological type \nprovides a basic structure similar to Hofstedes operating \nsystem.\" For them, the patterns of psychological type are a \nuniversal component of human nature. In their view of \nhuman functioning, type preferences would fit in the base of \nHofstedes diagram and, along with culture, shape each \nhuman personality. \n\nSocial and cultural anthropologists have not, for the \nmost part, accepted or even explored this Jungian hypothe- \nsis.^ The focus of cultural study and theory has been on the \nseemingly endless variety of ways in which human beings \nhave organized themselveson culturally derived differ- \nences in assumptions, values, morals, laws, customs, and \nbehavior. On the other hand, psychologists, counselors, \nand organizational development specialists using psycho- \nlogical type and the MBTI have produced a significant \namount of information about the applicability and useful- \nness of psychological type in a wide variety of cultures. \nTheir experience and research gencrally support the univer- \nsality of psychological type patterns. \n\nThose who would usc the MBTI in multicultural settings \nneed to be knowledgeable about and respectful of both the \ndifferences in people related to culture and the similarities \nrelated to psychological type patterns. \n\nMuch more research, such as Wilson and Languis (1989) \nstudy of brain wave pattern differences and the studies \nreported in Kirby and Barger (1996), is needed to demon- \nstrate the common mental patterns that psychological type \n\nSpecific to Inherited \nindividual and learned \nPERSONALITY \n\nSpecific \nto group \nor category \n\nLearned \n\nUniversal inherited \n\nFigure 14.1 Three Levels of Uniqueness in Human Mental \nProgramming \n\nSource.

The remainder of this chapter examines \nquestions related to use of the instrument. \n\nThe basic question lor practitioners who want to usc the \nMBTI in other cultures is this: Will the MBTI assist their \nclients in identifying their Jungian type preferences? The \nitems on the Indicator ask respondents to choose between \neveryday surface behaviors that Myers believed indicate the \ndecper, underlving patterns of type. The kinds of behaviors \nshe used are affected by cultural values and norms. The \nMBTI was developed and tested primarily with middle- \nclass, White Americans, and rescarch reports significant \nevidence for the Inventorys reliability and validity when it is \nused with people who are culturally similar to them (Ham- \nmer, 1996b; Myers @ McCaulley, 1985; sce also Chapters 8 \nand 9 of this manual). Will those same questions work to \nindicate type in groups with different cultural values and \n\nnorms? Is there comparable evidence for the reliability and \nvalidity of the MBTI in cultures other than that of middle- \nclass, White Americans? \n\nReliability and Validity of the MBTI \nin Other Cultures \n\nThe selection of items and the calculation of item weights \nfor the new Form M of the MBTI included a much more \nrepresentative sampling of U.S. co-cultural groups than \nthose used to develop and standardize the inventorys ear- \nlier forms. Currently available studies of the reliability and \nvalidity of the MBTI in other cultures are based on Form G. \nThis research, reported in Kirby and Barger (1996), \nincludes significant evidence for the reliability and validity \nof the MBTI in a variety of other groups with different cul- \ntural characteristics. \n\nFor example, hundreds of studies of the validity of the \nMBTI conducted in predominantly English-speaking cul- \ntures report results very similar to those of validity studies \nconducted in the United States. These include reports of \nstudents type preferences and major fields of study (Casas, \n1990; Borham &amp; Watts, 1994); comparisons of type distri- \nbutions of school administrators in Canada (Anderson, \n1992) with those in the United States; differences in type \ndistributions in United Kingdom organizations with those \nin different cultures (Oswick, Mahoney, &amp; Stein, 1994); \ncomparisons of type distributions of police officers in Aus- \ntralia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (Lidgard \n&amp; Bates, 1988); and others. \n\nDozens of studies of the MBTI in more diverse cultures \nalso provide validity evidence. Among others, Call and \nSotillo (1993) compared results on the Group Embedded \nFigures Test and type for U.S. students and students from \nSpanish-speaking countries; Yao (1993) analyzed types of \nfemale school administrators in the Peoples Republic of \nChina; Lim (1994) reported results of using the MBTI with \nSingaporean high school students; Van Rooyen (1994) \ncompared results of South African female managers on the \nKirton Adaption and Innovation Inventory and the MBTI to \nresults obtained in similar U.S. studies; and numerous prac- \ntiioners described their use of the MBTI with diverse \ngroups in the United States (Huitt, 1989; Jones, Ukishima, \nSakamoto, Tanouye, &amp; Giron, 1995; Levy &amp; Ostrowski, \n1983; Simmons &amp; Barrineau, 1994). \n\nA recent study with two groups of Whites in South \nAfrica provided additional support for the validity of the \nMBTI in that country (Zietsmann, 1996). One group con- \nsisted of 804 White adult high school graduates; the other \nof 1,943 \"reasonably representative of the white South \nAfrican population with a very diverse sampling of profes- \nsions, industries, and status levels\" (p. 186). Using factor \nanalysis of the responses, Zietsmaun found the meaning of \nthe MBTI items and scalcs is substantially the same for South \nAfrican subjects as it is for U.S. subjects\" (p. 186; italics in \n\nUses of Type in Multicultural Seuings 369 \n\noriginal). No comparable study has yet been completed \nwith their sample of Black South Africans. \n\nThe great majority of multicultural and international \nMBTI studies report results comparable to those found in \nsimilar studies in the United States and support the validity \nof the MBTI instrument when used appropriately in those \ncultures. \n\nCultural Groups for Whom \nthe MBTI May Not Be Appropriate \n\nSome practitioners have found that the MBTI personality \ninventory may not work to identify type preferences in cul- \ntures in which group or communal identity is a central \nvalue. Hofstede refers to such cultures as colleetivist and \ndefines them as societies in which the interest of the group \nprevails over the interest of the individual (1991, p. 50). \n\nThe MBTI has been used successfully in many cultures \nin which group social values are important: Latin American \ncountries such as Mexico and Brazil, Asian nations such as",

However, when a culture combines values \nabout the centrality of group identity with the experience \nof oppression, as is truc for many indigenous cultures, the \nMBTI may be less appropriate. \n\nFor example, Jopie De Beer (1997), a South African psy- \nchologist, reported on a database of almost 6,500 South \nAfricans including 930 Blacks. She expressed this concern \nabout use of the MBTI within Black South African culture: \n\nGroup solidarity amongst the indigenous people of Africa and \nin particular South Africa is often referred to as UBUNTU \n(umuntu ngumuntu ngabantuor, a person only becomes a \nperson through other people). UBUNTU is characterized by \nthe following values: solidarity, cooperation, hospitality, toler- \nance, joyful service, harmony, dignity, compassion, consensus, \ntrust, compromise, accommodation, caring about others, and \nreadiness to go the extra mile.\" (p. 12) \n\nColin Hopkirk (personal communication, 1997) reported \nsimilar questions about using the MBTI with New Zealand \nMaori who remain primarily within their native culture. He \ngave the following explanation of the cultural values that may \nmake the MBTI inappropriate for this group: \"[T]hey per- \nceive and experience themselves first as a part of the whole \ncreation, second as part of the hapu (tribe) of which they are \nthe product, third as part of the whanau (extended family) \nfrom which they descend, and only last as a distinct individ- \nual personality.\" \n\nCollectivist values may make it difficult for individuals \nwithin these cultures to respond to the MBTI lor at least \ntwo reasons: \n\nI. The centrality and importance ol group identity and \ncultural norms may make it difficult for individuals to \nidentily and report their natural individual prefer- \nences. Practitioners who use the MBTI in organiza- \ntional settings within the United States find that an \n\n370 The Uses of Type \n\norganizations cultural norms influence peoples abil- \nity to report their natural type preferences (Kum- \nmerow, 1988), and we would expect that broader cul- \ntural norms would also influence an individual's \ndesire and ability to use the instrument to indicate his \nor her underlying preferences. \n\n. The ways in which type preferences are expressed \nwithin these cultures may be significantly different \n(rom the ways in which those preferences are gener- \nally described from the perspective of an individual- \nistic culture. In a culture that expects and values regu- \nlar family/group interaction, for example, Introversion \nmay not be expressed by finding time alone. Instead, \nindividuals preferring Introversion may have found \nother waysacceptable in their cultureto support \ntheir need for internal processing time. Thereforc, the \nitems on the MBTI may not tap in to the ways in- \ndividuals in that culture experience and express their \npsychological type preferences. For more informa- \ntion on this, see the section in this chapter on inter- \npreting the MBTI. \n\nIn spite of these anticipated difficulties, Hopkirk (per- \nsonal communication, 1997) stated that, in his experience, \nMaori who are bicultural seem to accept the MBTI and \noften find it sensible and useful. Likewise, De Beer made \nthe following observation about using the MBTI with South \nAfrican Whites, Afrikaaners, and Blacks: We have not really \nhad major problems with people responding to the indica- \ntor... . [W]e have been surprised at how easily most cul- \ntures seem to understand the items (De Beer, personal com- \nmunication, 1997). \n\nThat the MBTI personality inventory may not work to \nidentify psychological type in some collectivist cultures does \nnot, of course, necessarily invalidate Jungs hypothesis that \nthese individuals have psychological type preferences. It does \nencourage caution when using the MBTI in such settings. \n\nIn deciding whether the MBTI is appropriate for clients \nfrom collectivist cultures, practitioners need to assess \ndegrees of acculturation. Clients whose primary cultural \nreference is their collectivist culture may find taking the \nMBTI unhelpful or even offensive, while those who are \nbicultural or whose primary reference is the majority cul- \nture are less likely to experience such difficulties. \n\nPractitioners who have questions about the cultural \nappropriateness of using the MBTI with particular groups or \nindividuals should consult resources such as the following: \n\nw Rollock and Terrell (1996), Multicultural Issues in Assess- \nment: Toward An Inclusive Model \n\nm Sue (1998), Multicultural Counseling Competencies: Indi- \nvidual and Organizational Development \n\nw American Psychological Association (1990), Guidelines \nfor Providers of Psychological Services to Ethnic, Linguistic \nand Culturally Diverse Populations \n\n8 Dana (1993), Multicultural Assessment: Perspective for \nProfessional Psychology \nW Brislin (1990), Applied Cross-Cultural Psychology",

Their Native American (primarily Navaho \nand Hopi) clients willingly complete the Indicator and seem \nto find it useful for understanding communication and team \nfunctioning; however, these practitioners question its uscful- \nness for increasing self-understanding for these clients. Their \nNative cultures include traditional ways for members to dis- \ncover the meaning of their lives and to understand how their \nindividual existence fits within the history and tradition of \nthe family and tribe. It may be that the culturally identified \nways for developing self-understanding for individuals in \nthese cultures will work better and be more appropriate than \nthe MBTI and psychological type theory (K. Salazar and G. \nSanchez, personal communication, 1997). \n\nOn the other hand, Mary E. Loomis, a Jungian analyst \nand coauthor of the Singer-Loomis Inventory, used Native \nAmerican concepts such as the medicine wheel, the Powers \nol the Four Directions, and the Star Maiden Circle as analo- \ngies for Jungs psychological tvpe theory in her Dancing the \nWhecl of Psychological Types (1991). In her view, the two \napproaches to human functioning are complementary. \n\nA more thorough understanding of cultural values in \nindigenous and collectivist cultures may allow MBTI practi- \ntioners to develop culturally congruent ways to present \nJungs theory of human functioning. \n\nCultural Differences in the Expression \nof Psychological Type: Extraversion \nand Introversion \n\nThe following anecdote was reported by two members of the \nAssociation for Psychological Type, a professional associa- \ntion for users of psychological type, whose membership is \nprimarily from North America. The story illustrates an \nimportant issue in using the MBTI with cultures other than \nones own. \n\nWhen we first attended a psychological type conference in Great \nBritain in 1991, we observed to colleagues at the end of the first \nevening, \"You dont seem to have any ENFPs at this conference.\" \nThey assured us that, as in the United States, ENFPs were well \nrepresented in the British Association for Psychological Type \nand many were present at the conference. We commented that, \nfrom our U.S. experience, we couldnt identily ENFPsor \nthose preferring Extraversion more generallybecause they \nwere not exhibiting the characteristics we associated with \nExtraversion in the United States. The response of our British \ncolleagues was that they found it similarly difficult to identify \nthose preferring Introversion in the United States because U.S. \n\nIntroverts exhibited behavior that in the United Kingdom was \nassociated with Extraversion: sociability, comfort with small \ntalk, disclosure of personal information, energetic and fast- \npaced conversation, and so forth. \n\nSome practitioners and researchers have looked to type \ndisiributions in different cultures to explain differences in \nbehavior, believing, for example, that there must be more \npeople preferring Introversion in Britain than in the United \nSiates. However, the 1997 normative type sample studies \nconducted in the United Kingdom and the United States \nproduced very similar percentages of people preferring \nExtraversion and Introversionabout 5096-5096 in each \ncase (see Table 14.1 on p. 379). The difference noted in indi- \nvidual behavior in group settings or with strangers is not due \nto differences in type preference distribution between the \nUnited Kingdom and the United States but instead is due to \nthe ways cultural norms and expectations affect expression \nol type. \n\nEach culture defines appropriate ways to express particular \n\npreferences. \n\nBecause culture influences the ways type is expressed, \npractitioners may need to modify their type definitions, and \nespecially the behaviors they associate with type prefer- \nences in their examples, to communicate type effectively in \nanother culture. The preferred way to do this is to interview \nindividuals or groups about how they experience and \nexpress their type preferences within their culture. Evi- \ndence from interviews with people of different types in a \nvariety of cultures supports both the existence of the under- \nlying type patterns and differences in the ways they are \nexperienced and expressed in different cultures (Barger &amp; \nKirby, 1993, 1995b; Intravisit, 1986). \n\nCultural Differences in the Expression of \nPsychological Type: Sensing and Judging \n\nTo date, almost every culture for which there are type data \nreports a predominance of Sensing Judging types, and the \ngreat majority report STJ as the modal type in the culture \n(Casas, 1990).

Yet \nthe South African database of 6,452 people reports ESTJ and \nIST] as the most common types for Black South Africans, as \nwell as for Whites. Among the 5,000 White South Africans, \n\nUses of Type in Multicultural Settings 371 \n\nthese two types accounted for almost 39% of the group, \nwhile 67.6% of the 930 Black South Africans reported these \ntypes. De Beer believed that, based on her own work in veri- \nfying type results with Black South Africans, the STJ pre- \ndominance shown in the database is correct. This seeming \ncontradiction can be explained when one carefully exam- \nines the underlying dynamic of STJ types, rather than \napplving behavioral standards from other cultures. \n\nThe combination of preferences for Sensing, Thinking, \nand Judging produces a type that introverts Sensing and \nextraverts Thinking in Jungs dynamic picture of types. \n(Kirby and Barger addressed the behavioral implications of \nintroverted Sensing in depth in \"Multicultural Applica- \ntions,\" MBTI Applications, 1996.) A culture-neutral descrip- \ntion of STJs pictures them as factual, reality-based types: \nThey take reality as a given and internalize the history, tra- \nditions, and customs of their culture as the way things \nare.\" They enjoy belonging to a group aud feel great loyalty \ntoward that groups past, present, and future. Preserving \nculture and traditions is a primary value. \n\nBecause of this underlying pattern, the observable be- \nhavior of STJs is likely to clearly fit the cultural values of the \ngroup to which they belong. When their culture values \n\"solidarity, cooperation, hospitality, tolerance, joyful ser- \nvice, harmony, dignity, compassion, consensus, trust, com- \npromise, accommodation, caring about others, and readi- \nness to 'go the extra mile\" (De Beer, 1997, p. 12), as Black \nSouth African culture does, STJs are likely to display behav- \niors congruent with those values. To American eyes, this \nbehavior may appear very different from expectations of \nSTJ behavior based on U.S. cultural experience. \n\nInterpretations of type-related behavior formed through \nwork with middle-class U.S. clients may distort or compro- \nmise understanding of type in other cultures. What is \nneeded is a thorough understanding of the underlying type \npattern and then exploration of how that pattern may be \nexpressed within a particular culture. \n\nSummary \n\nUsing any psychological instrument in a culture different \nfrom that in which it was developed and tested requires cau- \ntion and respect for diversity; however, MBT! researchers \nand practitioners in a wide variety of cultures report results \nvery similar to those found by researchers and practitioners \nusing the MBTI in the United States. Current evidence sup- \nports use of the MBTI in most multicultural settings. \n\nIn cultures with value systems that can be described as \ncollectivist, the MBTI may not be appropriate. Practitioners \nshould carefully consider its value and assess whether psy- \nchological type is a useful tool for self-understanding for \nthese clients. \n\nWhen using the MBT! in multicultural or international \nsettings, practitioners need to be aware that cultural values \nare likely to affect the ways in which individuals express \n\n372 The Uses of Type \n\ntheir type preferences. Examples of behavioral patterns \nbased on U.S. samples may need to be modified or changed \nto reflect the ways cultural norms have influenced clients \ntype-related behavioral habits. \n\nPractical Concerns About \nMulticultural Use of the MBTI \n\nMost of the studies reported above and in the research sum- \nmaries in MBTI Applications (Kirby and Barger, 1996) used \nForm G (sometimes with minor spelling changes; for exam- \nple, organise instead of organize). The use of the standard \nForm G or Form M with clients from other cultures re- \nquires attention to some practical issues related to client \nreading level, age, and language. The suggestions in Chapter \n6, Administration, about reading level and age need to be \napplied to multicultural clients in ways that fit for the cul- \nture. Additionally, the sometimes colloquial and idiomatic \nlanguage of the Indicator may create difficulties for some \nclients with English as a second language (ESL). \n\nReading Levels \n\nClients taking the MBTI personality inventory need to have \na rcading level of seventh grade (approximately 12- to 13- \nyear-olds) or above, based on U.S. reading norms.

    "content": "United States, eighth graders are usually about 13 years old \nand have completed seven or eight years of schooling. Prac- \ntitioners are encouraged to find ways to check their clients \nreading levels in English. Wederspahn and Barger (1988) \nreported a thorough study using Form G with well-educated \nFilipinos. Based on this, they recommended a TOEFL (Test \nof English as a Foreign Language) level of 500 as a mini- \nmum, but there are no official guidelines or comparable \nresearch studies on this question. \n\nAge Levels \n\nThe MBTI is appropriate for adults and young people 15 \nyears of age or older. Caution is recommended for use with \nyounger clients (ages 12 to 14), and it is not recommended \nfor use with children below I2 years old except for research \npurposes. Reliabilities for younger clients are typically \nslightly lower (though still acceptable) than those for adults, \nwhich Myers and McCaulley (1985) suggested may relate to \nissues of type development in younger respondents. \n\nThe Murphy-Meisgeier Type Indicator for Children \n(MMTIC) is recommended for children approximately 7 to \n13 years old. The MMTIC consists of questions about every- \nday experiences common to children in the United States, \nsuch as Item #8: You like to have: A. Lots of friends; B. A \nfew close friends. The MMTIC Manual (Meisgcier &amp; Mur- \nphy, 1987) states that the reading levcl for their instrument \n\nis 2.0 using a modified Fry system, and, with the exception \nof one or two items, the experiences drawn upon in thc \nitems are at least potentially common to children attending \nschool in a wide variety of cultures. \n\nLanguage Issues \n\nWhen the MBTI is used with clients for whom English is \nnot the native language, some special considerations arise, \nand it is appropriate to check understanding before decid- \ning to use the Indicator. According to the study by Weder- \nspahn and Barger (1988), even when non-native English \nspeakers had sufficient command of English to understand \nthe words in the MBII Form G, the use of idioms in some \nitems created problems for their Filipino clients: A speaker \nof English as a second language (ESL) may know all the \nwords in the idiom 'somcone who has both fcet on the \nground' without understanding the meaning of the phrase \n(practical/realistic), which is crucial to making a meaning- \nful choice on this item\" (p. 12). \n\nMany of the low frequency vocabulary items\" in Form \nG that created problems for Wederspahn and Bargers Fil- \nipino clients have been eliminated in Form M. A few remain \nbecause they are good items in the United States, but they \nmay be problematic for all but very advanced speakers of \nEnglish. The following are words or phrases on Form M \nthat were difficult for Wederspahn and Bargers clients and \nthat practitioners may wish to check with their ESL clients: \n\ningenious \ncramp (does a schedule cramp you?) \nhearty \n\ncherish \n\nSome of the idioms in Form G that Wederspahn and \nBarger found particularly troublesome to ESL speakers have \nalso been removed, but a few remain and, again, should be \nchecked with clients for understanding: \n\na good mixer \nleave you cold \nto be tied down \nplunge in \n\ngo with the flow \n\nThe word pairs can create special problems, even for \nadvanced speakers of English, because these items require \nrespondents to choose between different possible definitions \nof the words and to understand the connotations in the \nUnited States. Wederspahn and Barger asked their clients \nhow they defined touching (half of word pair #33, Form M: \n\"convincing-touching\"). Their clients responded, making \nphysical contact with the fingers, a correct dictionary def- \nnition but not one likely to help respondents indicate their \npreference for Thinking or Feeling as the item intends. \nWhen Barger used Form G with a group of ESL managers of \n\na Southeast Asian oil company (with clients from five differ- \nent Southeast Asian cultures), she found that they were com- \nfortable with their overall results, but they did ask about the \nmeaning of the word compassion, which occurs in three \nForm M questions: word pair #40, compassion-foresight; \nword pair #53, compassionatelogical; and phrase ques- \ntion #87, Which is a higher compliment, to be called (A) \ncompetent, or (B) compassionate?\" \n\nP A. Schmidt (personal communication, 1997), who \nworks in Arab countries in the Middle East, reported client \ndifficulties with the same items and words reported by \nWederspahn and Barger. She indicated that she deals \nfrankly with the language concerns of her ESL clients by \nsaying something like this: \n\nYou may encounter some idioms with which you are not famil- \niar, or vou may find some words for which vou are not sure of \nthe meaning.

Many ESL clientsespecially those working in orga- \nnizational settingswill be familiar with American idioms, \nand the number of questions affected by language concerns \nis small. In general, ESL clients find most items easy to \nanswer, and, with attention to reading level, age, and possi- \nble language issues, both practitioner and client can feel \nconfident of the validity of their overall results on the MBTI. \n\nTranslations of the MBTI \n\nWhile the MBTI has achieved satisfactory results in a wide \nvariety of cultures, a validated translation of the Indicator in \nthe clients native language is generally the preferred choice. \nThe following sixteen translations have sufficient reliability \nand validity evidence to be sold commercially: \n\nAnglicized English \n\nAustralian English \n\nBahasa Malay \n\nChinese \n\nDanish \n\nDutch \n\nEuropean French \n\nFrench Canadian \n\nUses of Type in Multicultural Settings 373 \n\nGerman \n\nItalian \n\nKorean \n\nNorwegian \nPortuguese \nSpanish \nSpanish/Castellano \nSwedish \n\nTranslations into additional languages are currently \nlisted as research instruments and are typically being \ntested for reliability and validity. Practitioners wanting \ninformation about commercially available translations and \nabout those currently being developed and tested should \ncontact Consulting Psychologists Press. \n\nChallenges Faced by Translators of the MBTI \n\nEduardo Casas, recipient ol the Isabel Briggs Myers Memor- \nial Research Award in 1991 for his French translation of the \nMBTI, has done more than any other person to clarify what \nis required to develop a valid translation of the MBTI \n(Casas, 1990). The process and principles Casas identified \nwere parallel in all essentials to those used by Isabel Myers \nin her original construction of the instrument as outlined in \nChapter 9 of the 1985 Manual. \n\nSome of the challenges faced by translators of the MBTI \nare outlined below. \n\nConceptual Challenges Translators must strive to find \nbehaviors and attitudes related to type preferences that are \nappropriate for their culture. The UBUNTU values \ncharacteristic of South African Blacks described earlier, for \nexample, include many concepts typically used in Western \ncultures to describe the Feeling function. If these are cul- \ntural values followed by most people in this culture, how \ncan a translator find concepts and words that distinguish \nbetween Thinking and Feeling for this group? \n\nLinguistic Challenges According to De Beer (personal \ncommunication, [997), the Zulu language has very few \nwords that convey the concept of the Intuition function, \ncreating a challenge for developing a valid translation of the \nSensing-Intuition dichotomy into that language. Sim and \nKim (1993) reported difficulty in translating idiomatic \nexpressions such as eramp you. \n\nCultural Value Challenges Sim and Kim (1993) reported \nthat they needed to rewrite some MBTI Form G items when \nthey developed their Korean translation because \"the Korean \nculture does not Favor the expression of emotions and \nfeelings (p. 19). Some of these Form G items that did not \nwork with their Korean sample remain on Form M: \n\nthinking 'A' B feeling \nhearty A B quiet \n\n374 The Uses of Type \n\nSummary \n\nTranslators who have successfully faced these challenges and \nfollowed the steps in item development, analysis, testing, \nand weighting used hy Isabel Myers in her original construc- \ntion of the MBTI have developed reliable and valid transla- \ntions. And they have found what Eduardo Casas (1995) \ncalled \"experiential validity\" as they have used these ver- \nsionsthat is, their translations work for respondents. If \nsuch a translation of the MBTI is available in the clients \nnative language, practitioners should choose the translation. \n\nMulticultural Scoring Issues \n\nMyers described item weighting as the way the MBTI \naccounts for the social desirability of items (Myers &amp; \nMcCaulley, 1985). In cultures with values different from \nthose of Americans, one would expect that the social desir- \nability of some items will be different, and therefore those \nitems should be weighted differently to provide clients with \nthe most accurate results. \n\nWeighting of Items in Translations of the MBTI \n\nDeveloping a valid translation of the Indicator includes test- \ning the translation on a representative sample group and \ncollecting the data needed to assign appropriate item \nweights. Casas (1990), for example, found that the corre- \nsponding French words for the Introverted options on \nForm G item #31, quiet (Form M item #32); Form G item",

    "content": "#37, reserved (Form M item 238); and Form G item #40, \n\"calm\" (not on Form M), did not discriminate between \nIntroverts and Extraverts in his representative sample \ngroups of Francophone Canadians. Fither the words used \nin the translation were inadequate, or cultural values in the \nFrench Canadian population supported the choice of these \nwords by both Introverts and Extraverts. Because they do \nnot discriminate, these options carry a weight of 0 in Casas \nFrench translation. \n\nItem Weights in Other Cultures \n\nDillerences in social desirability affect responses to the stan- \ndard MBTI as well as to translations of the MBTI. Casas \n(1990) calculated prediction ratios on MBTI items for a rep- \nresentative sample of Anglophone Canadian students, for \nexample, and found that some items reccived prediction \nratios sulficiently different from those of Americans that the \nweighting for those items would be different in Canada. \nForm G word-pair question #31, *hearty-quiet\" (Form M \nitem #32) discriminates between those preferring Extraver- \nsion and those preferring Introversion in the United States. \nFor the native English speakers in Casas Canadian sample, \nhowever, quiet was the overwhelming choice, and there- \nfore the weighting of scores on this item would be different. \n\nOxlord Psychologists Press (Kendall &amp; McHenry, 1998) \nconducted research on 196 of Isabel Myers MBTI Form J \nitems using a census-based national representative sample \nof adults (N = 1,634) in the United Kingdom. Based on this \nstudy, Betsy Kendall and Robert McHenry of Oxford Psy- \nchologists Press created a research version of the MBTI with \nitem weights based on the U.K. sample responses. They \nthen conducted best-fit type studies using Form G and their \nresearch version. The result of this comprehensive project \nwas publication of the European English MBTI Step l: 87 \nforced-choice items (63 Form G items plus 24 Form J \nitems) scored using U.K. item weights. Their best-fit type \nstudies indicate a significant increase in best-fit results for \nU.K. clients (from 6396 on Form G to 7296 on the European \nEnglish MBTI Step 1), with the largest increase occurring on \nthe Extraversion-Introversion dichotomy. \n\nBathurst (personal communication, 1997) developed \nexperimental item weights based on MBTI responses in \nsamples of convenience in New Zealand. His analysis indi- \ncates that, based on his sample groups, about 4396 of the \nMBTI items would receive weights different from those \nassigned on the U.S. Form G scoring keys. When Bathurst \ncompared overall MBTI results using U.S. and culture- \nspecific scoring weights, however, MBTI type changed only \nslightly, with most of the changes occurring on dichotomies \non which clients had low preference scores. \n\nPsychometrics Canada Ltd., MBTI distributor in Canada, \nand Australian Psychologists Press, MBTI distributor in Aus- \ntralia, are conducting research using representative samples \nin their cultures (Danielle Poirier, personal communication, \n1997; David Freeman, personal communication, 1997). \nThese studies may result in culture-specific scoring weights. \nWhen such culturally adjusted scoring is not available, U.S. \nscoring keys can be used, with additional time and energy \ndirected toward helping clients verify type results, especially \nfor those with results near the midpoint. \n\nSummary \n\nIdeally, practitioners would be able to choose MBTI scoring \noptions for multicultural clients that use item weights \nbased on the social desirability of items in their culture. \nPractically, these are not widely available at the present \nlime. Fortunately, using scoring weights developed with \nU.S. samples does not appear to present a significant prob- \nlem for multicultural clients. \n\nResearch conducted by Consulting Psychologists Press to \ncreate Form M resulted in replacing 4596 of the Form G items \n(often with minor wording changes). A number of items that \nachieved satisfactory prediction ratios in the United States in \nthe mid-1970s, when Form G was created, did not meet the \nitem selection criteria discussed in Chapter 7. Form M has \nnot yet been tested with multicultural populations, but its \nreliabilities are higher than those for Form G with diverse \nU.S. populations, as is its reporting of best-fit type. Future \nresearch will indicate whether this new form also provides \nbetter results in multicultural settings. \n\nAdministering and Interpreting \nthe MBTI in Multicultural Settings \n\nThe primary goal during administration is creating a climate \nthat allows clients to report their truc or best-fit type prefer- \nences when they respond to the MBTI items. The primary \ngoal during interpretation is to assist clients in processing \ntheir MBTI results to decide on their best-fit type. The stan- \ndard instructions, outlined in Chapters 5 and 6, provide clear \nguidelines for practitioners. However, achieving these goals \nwith clients from other cultures may require additional care.",

Can I usc the standard instructions when adminis- \n\ntering the MBTI to clients in other cultures? \nYes, with some modifications or additions. Most mul- \nticultural practitioners use the standard instructions, \nbut some also report developing instructions that \ncommunicate more effectively with their clients or \nspending extra time on parts of the instructions that \nmay pose problems within their culture. \n\nFor example, trainers at Oxford Psychologists \nPress (the U.K. distributor of the MBTI) have found \n(Kendall, personal communication, 1997) that the \nphrase shocs-off self, suggested in the 1985 Manual \nto convey the desired frame of mind for completing \nthe Indicator, does not communicate well to their \nclients. They communicate the concept of your nat- \nural self in other ways. \n\nPractitioners working with some Asian cultures \n(Park, 1996) report that the standard instruction \n\"there are no right or wrong answers\" requires addi- \ntional explanation for their clients, who are accus- \ntomed to receiving test results that compare them \nfavorably or unfavorably with others. \n\n. Do cultural values raise particular issues | need to \n\nconsider when administering the MBTI in other \ncultures? \nYes, and these will vary as cultures differ. For exam- \nple, in cultures in which position and age confer \nauthority, special care needs to be taken about who is \ngiving the Indicator or who may be participating in a \ngroup setting to ensure that clients feel comfortable \nresponding from their individual perspectives. \n\nA cultural norm of agreeableness, or at least of not \nquestioning, may also affect clients ability to report \n\nH2 \n\nUses of Type in Multicultural Settings 375 \n\ntheir own preferences. Practitioners using the MBTI in \nsome Arab cultures report (Schmidt, personal com- \nmunication, 1997) that these cultures favor people \nacting in a way that pleases and never offends.\" \nSchmidt has found it particularly important to empha- \nsize during administration that results are confidential \nand that the MBTI will be most helpful to everyone if \nrespondents report what they really prefer. \n\nCultures classified as colleetivist, in which group \nidentity is more important than individual identity, \nmay present special problems. De Beer (personal \ncommunication, 1997) and her colleagues are experi- \nmenting with providing the following context for \nadministration with indigenous people, who may find \nit difficult to respond outside of group norms: We \nknow you are a person well accepted by your com- \nmunity. Would you, however, in doing this question- \nnaire, go deep inside yourself to tell us who you know \nyourself to be, to tell us about your uniqueness. \n\n. What ean 1 do to give clients from cultural minority \n\ngroups the best opportunity to get MBTI results that \nare valid for them? \n\nDe Beer (personal communication, 1997) expresscd \nher concerns about using the Indicator with clients \nwhose race, gender, or ethnicity place them in a minor- \nity or disadvantaged position within their larger cul- \nture. De Beer raised the issue in relationship to Black \nSouth Africans, but the question has also been asked \nabout reported type of African Americans (Battle, 1989, \n1994) and of other U.S. co-cultural groups (Salazar &amp; \nSanchez, personal communication, 1997). Diliberio, \nHarrison, Sim, and Kim (1995) suggested that cultural \nvalues about gender and work roles affect womens abil- \nity to report thcir preference for Thinking or Fceling in \nseveral cultures. And in some cultures, religious affilia- \ntion or sexual orientation may create similar problems. \n\nClients who belong to a minority or disadvantaged \ngroup within their larger culture have often devel- \noped an adaptive coping personality style that they \nuse in interacting with the dominant culture. The \nconcern is that they may be inclined to report that \ndeveloped style rather than their actual underlying \ntype preferences. \n\nPractitioners can address these issues directly dur- \ning administration. Information such as the following \nmay be helpful to these clients: \n\nMost people have developed a lot of different behaviors \n\nrelated to work and lamily roles they play or relationships \n\nthey have. For some, the environment has required them \nto develop a coping personality style that is different in \nsignificant ways from who they might prefer to he. The \npurpose in taking the MBTI is to get at your own individ- \nual preferencesapart from the roles you play, the skills",

The interpretation and verification of MBTI results \nis the necessary starting point for this learning. For this \nprocess of understanding and applying type to be effec- \ntive, practitioners interpreting the MBTI in cultures other \nthan their own need to be especially sensitive about cul- \ntural differences in training and learning styles and in the \nways type may be experienced and expressed in the partic- \nular culture. Assisting clients in making type useful in \ntheir lives requires interpreting type in ways that fit cul- \nturally for them. \n\nI. What kinds of general issues do I need to consider \n\nwhen structuring the feedback session for multicul- \ntural clients? \nThe general principle is that practitioners need to be \nsensitive to cultural custcms and norms related to \ntraining, learning, and appropriate behavior. In cul- \ntures in which psychological testing is not customary \nand/or where training programs are unusual, practi- \ntioners need to be especially sensitive about creating a \nsafe environment for interpretation and verification \nin group and individual feedback. For group interpre- \ntation, this includes understanding power and au- \nthority relationships within the culture and taking \ncare about who will participate. \n\nWhen using the MBTI in a culture other than their \nown, practitioners need to anticipate that participant \nbehavior may differ from their usual experience and \nprepare themselves by seeking information about \ntraining and learning styles within that culture. For \nexample, in some cultures, asking questions of the \npresenter and interjecting comments is considered \nimpolite or aggressive behavior. \n\nHolstedes (1980) landmark study based on his \nsurvey of 116,000 employees of a large multinational \nfirm in 50 countries identified two cultural differ- \nences that may especially influence client expecta- \ntions and behavior related to receiving MBTI feed- \nback. Hofstede defined these as follows: power \ndistance,\" the degree to which a culture recognizes \nand respects authority relationships or, conversely, \nemphasizes equality of power; and \"uncertainty \navoidance,\" the degree to which a culture values sta- \nbility and rules to ensure stability or, conversely, \nencourages diversity of ideas and behavior. These two \ncultural differences will particularly affect the ways in \nwhich participants view their behavior within a group \nand their relationship to a group leader. \n\n2. Are there some specific issues related to practi- \n\ntioner style that I need to take into account when \nplanning an MBTI feedback session? \n\nYes. MBTI practitioners in other cultures report that \nclients in some cultures find the American style of \ntraining very fast paced and energetic. In fact, one \ngroup of Finnish clients (Barger, personal communi- \ncation, 1995) referred to their American trainers as \nlike actors. In general, experience giving MBTI \nfeedback in a variety of cultures seems to support \nmodification of the pacing of the session, with clients \nrequesting a slower pace than the rapid style charac- \nteristic of many U.S. trainers (Kendall, personal com- \nmunication, 1997; Fitzgerald, personal communica- \ntion, 1997). U.S. trainers have found that giving \nparticipants regular pauses for individual reflection or \nfor discussions with a partner seem helpful in these \nsettings, and time for these kinds of activities needs to \nbe built in when planning the session. \n\nSome cultures may require an altogether different \napproach to the feedback process from that familiar in \nthe United States and other Western countries. De \nBeer (personal communication, 1997) reported that, \nwhen interpreting to professionals in South Africa, \npractitioners typically follow the general outline of \nsessions in the United States. However, indigenous \npeople in rural areas in South Africa prefer to hear \nabout type concepts in the form of a meeting called \nan indaba, perhaps facilitated by a church group. \nInterested people, led by the eldest of the community, \nhave a discussion at a leisurely pace about, for exam- \nple, Introversion. Then, the next week, they have a \ndiscussion about Extraversion, and so on. \n\nTaking account of the expectations and needs of \nclients when structuring feedback sessions requires \nboth a willingness to adapt ones normal approach \nand some information about the clients.

What resources are available 10 allow me to develop \n\nmy knowledge of these issues in another culture? \n\nThe following are some resources that we have found \n\nparticularly helpful for the trainer crossing cultures: \nUnderstanding Cultures Influence on Behavior \n(Brislin, 1993) provides a basic summary of this \nissue in language accessible to those outside of \ncultural anthropology. \n\nIntercultural Communication: A Reader (Samovar &amp; \nPorter, 1991) identifies sensitive issues and pro- \nvides a wealth of information for communicating \ncffectively across cultural differences. \n\nCultures Consequences: International Differences in \nWorh-Related Values (Hofstede, 1980) presents Hof- \nstedes analysis of his survey of cultural differences \n\nin 116,000 employees of a single multinational \nfirm in 50 different countries; many of these differ- \nences suggest ways to adapt training/presentation \nstyles. \n\nCultures and Organizations: Software of the Mind \n(Hofstede, 1991) especially focuses on cultural dif- \nferences related to work. \n\nInternational Dimensions of Organizational Behavior \n(Adler, 1991) also addresses the influence of cul- \ntural differences within business organizations. \nThese are considered culture-general approaches \n(Brislin, Cushner, Cherrie, &amp; Yong, 1986), that is, for \nthe most part, they deal with general issues related to \nworking in a different culture or communicating with \npeople in another culture. For \"culture-specific\" in- \nformation, we recommend beginning with a Cultur- \ngram,\" which can be obtained from the David M. \nKennedv Center for International Studies at Brigham \nYoung University. Culturgrams provide the practi- \ntioner with brief summaries of basic information \nabout more than 100 different cultures. \n. Do I need to adjust my basic presentation of type \ninformation when working with multicultural \nclients? \nYes. Practitioners using the MBTI cross-culturally \nhave found that they need to modify their normal \npresentation because of a couple of important differ- \nences: The specific examples or stories they use to \nillustrate type preference differences may not be famil- \niar or may not be perceived in the same ways in differ- \nent cultures; and type preferences may be experienced \nand expressed differently in another culture from the \nway they are within the practitioners own culture. \nEach of these differences requires developing ways to \npresent type concepts and definitions that fit for the \ngroup to whom the practitioner is interpreting. \n\nOf course, adapting MBTI feedback to clients is a \nbasic practitioner skill. Working within their own cul- \nture, practitioners use type explanations and examples \ndifferently when they are interpreting to a family, for \nexample, than when they are interpreting the same \nmaterial to a work group. When interpreting within a \ncountry or culture different from ones own, this prac- \ntitioner skill needs to be used consistently. \n\nSome of the needed modifications are fairly obvi- \nous. For example, illustrations of SensingIntuition \ndifferences commonly used in the United States \napproaches to budgeting, descriptions ol time, ways of \nbalancing checking accounts, and the likefrequently \ndo not succeed in illustrating this difference in non- \nWestern cultures. \n\nSomewhat less obvious but even more important \nnecessary modifications come from the influence of \ncultural values and norms on the ways in which type \n\n307 \n\nUses of Type in Multicultural Settings \n\npreferences are experienced by individuals and \nexpressed in behavior in different cultures. Farlier \nsections of this chapter described differences in be- \nhavior associated with Extraversion and Introversion \nin the United States and in the United Kingdom, and \ndifferences in the normal, type-related behaviors dis- \nplaved by ST] types in different cultures. Practitioners \nusing the MBII in other cultures routinely report \nsuch behavioral differences. For example, Schmidt \n(personal communication, 1997) has found that \nsome behaviors typically seen as related to the judg- \ning function of Feeling in the United States are, \namongst her Saudi Arabian clients, the cultural norm: \nvaluing harmony and making decisions based on the \neffects of those decisions on other people. Her de- \nscriptions and examples of the Thinking and Feeling \nfunctions have had to be adjusted to communicate \nthe differences effectively to these clients. \n\nPreparing by doing research on the values and \nnorms of the culture within which one vill be inter- \npreting the MBTI is respectful and essential. Of even \ngreater value, perhaps, is an attitude of exploration \nwith clients. Experienced type practitioners have \nlearned that their best examples come from listening \nto people of a particular type describe themselves; this \nis doubly true when working with clients from a cul-",

What kinds of type descriptions and supporting \n\nmaterials are available lor working with multicul- \ntural groups in verifying type? \n\nType descriptions and supporting materials are a basic \npractitioner tool for verifying type. Research. with \nForm G in the United States has shown that clients \nagree with their reported type about 75% of the time, \nand when they disagree it is generally on one di- \nchotomy on which they had a low preference score \n(Myers &amp; McCaulley, 1985). Comparisons of MBTI \nresults and clients decisions about best-fit type from \nfour other English-speaking countries show similar \nresults (Kirby &amp; Barger, 1996). Best-fit type agreement \ninformation about Form M in other cultures is not yet \navailable. \n\nEven if the MBTI identified type preferences this \nwell in all cultures, 2096 to 2596 of clients would dis- \nagree with at least one preference reported. A full type \ndescription is the preferred tool for verifying client \nresults and for clarifying a preference that the client \nquestions. The overwhelming majority of type de- \nscriptions and supporting materials such as Introduc- \ntion to Type were first published in the United States \nand draw on the authors experiences with type as \nexpressed by Americans. In spite of the American per- \nspective inevitably present in these, practitioners in \nother countries report that the type descriptions in \n\n3/8 The Uses of Ivpe \n\nIntroduction to Type communicate well to their clients \n(Kendall, personal communication, 1997; D. Free- \nman, personal communication, 1997; P. Cauvin, per- \nsonal communication, 1997). \n\nAdditionally, some type descriptions and support- \ning materials based on the ways type is expressed in \na particular culture have been developed or are in \nprocess. The best source of information about cultur- \nally appropriate type descriptions and supporting \nmaterials is the distributor(s) of the MBTI personal- \nity inventory in the country with which the practi- \ntioner is working. The Consulting Psychologists \nPress catalog lists international distributors and con- \ntact information. \n\nSummary \n\nFor effective multicultural administration of the MBTI, \npractitioners not only need to be familiar with the standard \ninstructions but also need to consider cultural values that \nmay make it difficult for clients to respond according to \nthose instructions. Practitioners are advised to clarify these \nissues through private interviews with individual clienis, \nasking about their reactions to the instructions. And it is \nparticularly important to emphasize the customary instruc- \ntion: H you do not understand an item, just omit it and con- \ntinue. Clients are likely to get more accurate results if they \nhave omitted items in which the meaning is not clear to \nthem, in which they feel a conflict between the options, or \nin which they are uncomfortable choosing. \n\nMBTI interpretation and verification of results is the \ncontext in which type becomes of value to the client. For \nthis process of understanding and personal application to \nbe effective, practitioners using the MBTI in cultures other \nthan their own need to be especially sensitive to differ- \nences in training and learning styles and to differences in \nthe ways type may be experienced and expressed relative to \ncultural values. \n\nMulticultural Type \nDistribution Samples \n\nClients in multicultural settings want to know if the MBTI \nhas been used with cultural groups such as theirs and, if it \nhas, what kinds of type distributions seem characteristic \n(De Beer, personal communication, 1997; Kendall, personal \ncommunication, 1997). Practitioners currently have two \nbasic sources for information on type research and practice \nin various cultures. The research services of the Center for \nApplications of Psychological Type (CAPT) in Gainesville, \nFlorida, include a database that will produce type tables \nfrom different cultures and lists of articles, dissertations, \n\nand conference papers related to type in various cultures. \nAlso, the chapter Multicultural Applications\" in MBTI \nApplications (Kirby &amp; Barger, 1996) is a summary of pub- \nlished research on type in different cultures. \n\nMost of the information available about type and culture \nis in the form of type tables of MBTI results in different cul- \ntures. Fortunately, that is often the kind of information \nclients request. Using type tables to illustrate group type \ndistributions requires caution on the part of the practitioner \nfor several reasons. \n\nB Anumber of factors are known to affect reported type on \nthe MBTI: \n\n* AgcYounger groups more often report higher per- \ncentages of Extraversion and Perceiving than do com- \nparable older groups. \n\n* Education levelGroups with higher levels of educa- \ntion report higher percentages of Introversion than \ndo groups with less education completed. \n\n* Occupation or field of studyOccupations, specific",

Carefully assess the group to identify any factors \nknown to affect reported type that may be present in \nthe group. Never assume that because the number of \npeople is large, the group must therefore be representa- \ntive of the larger culture. \n\n. Recognize that reported type may be affected by a num- \nber of other group or individual factors, including cul- \ntural values. We would expect that 2026-2546 of a large \ngroup would, through the verification process, choose \na different type as their best fit than the one they \nreported on the MBTI. \n\nH2 \n\nNational Norming Samples of Type \n\nOne of the most frequently asked questions during type \ninterpretations is, What is the distribution of type prefer- \nences in this country or culture? The 1985 MBTI Manual \nincluded several estimates of the distribution of types in the \nU.S.: Isabel Myers Pennsylvania high school students, the \nMBTI databank at the Center for Applications of Psycho- \nlogical Type, and a study conducted by SRI International on \nAmerican Values and Life Styles (VALS; Myers &amp; McCaul- \nley, 1985, pp. 45-51). A national sample was analyzed by \nHammer and Mitchell (1996).

Table 14.1 \ndisplays the results of this weighted national sample, \nreporting separately on African Americans and Hispanics \nincluded within the larger national representative sample. \nDuring the same period, Oxford Psvchologists Press spon- \nsored a similar normative sampling of MBTI Form G \nresults in the United Kingdom. This U.K. type distribution \nis also displayed in Table 14.1. \n\nThe most notable pattern in all the normative samples \n(VALS, CPP's Form M sample, and OPP5 Form G sample) \nis the predominance of ISJ and ES] types, the four types \nthat, in type dynamics terms, introvert their Sensing func- \ntion. These four types total 4496-5296 of the people in each \nof the samples. When using such data, practitioners need \nto remember the cautions listed above, including that \nthese samples are based on reported type, rather than best- \n\nfit type. \nType Tables by Age and Education Level \n\nResearchers have produced several studies of type distribu- \nions in groups that may be presumed to be somewhat com- \nparable, and such samples may provide tentative projections \nof national type distributions.

The temptation for clients is to overinterpret type dis- \ntributions; thus practitioners need to emphasize the partial \nand tentative nature of most of the data available. Practition- \ners and their clients can identify patterns but need to inter- \npret with caution. \n\nConclusion \n\nThis chapter has emphasized differences when the MBTI is \nused in multicultural settings and cautions about its use \nwith people culturally different from those with whom it \n\nwas developed. It is also important to recognize the positive \nexperience of practitioners using the MBTI outside of the \nUnited States: \n\n|t: \n\nbh \n\nBoth psychological type and the MBTI have been \nused effectively in dozens of cultures, some very dif- \nferent from U.S. middle-class culture. \n\n. Research and practitioner experience in using the \n\nMBTI multiculturally is overwhelmingly positive \nclients recognize the patterns identified by psycho- \nlogical type, give examples of their use of preferences \nfrom their own experience, and find types identifica- \ntion of normal differences very helpful in increasing \ntheir understanding of themselves and others. \n\nThe perspective and ethics associated with psycho- \nlogical type and the MBTI, summarized by Myers as \n\"the constructive use of differences,\" make type and \nthe MBTI particularly useful in cross-cultural work \nand in multicultural settings, where respect for hu- \nman diversity is of paramount importance. \n\nSources and Descriptions of \nSamples of the 1998 Revision \n\nDescription of National Sample and \nNational Representative Sample \n\nNational Sample \n\nA stratified random sampling procedure was used to collect \nthe national sample. This procedure, collected in 1996, was \ndesigned to yield a sample that would be representative of the \nU.S. population. However, the actual sample does not match \nU.S. census data. Caucasian females are overrepresented, and \nAfrican American males are underrepresented, relative to the \nU.S. census data. Further, ethnic categories for people of \n\nAmerican Indian. Asian/Pacific Islander, or Eskimo/Aleut \ndescent were not available. \n\nNational Representative, \nor Weighted, Sample \n\nThe national representative, or weighted, sample was \ndeveloped to approximate the U.S. population in terms of \ngender and ethnicity (African American, Caucasian, His- \npanic/ Latino). Based on U.S. census data, weights for gen- \nder and ethnicity were applied to the national sample \n(described above) to yield the national representative, or \nweighted, sample.",

It should also be noted that Jung \nused the term sensation in his writings rather than Myers \npreferred term Sensing. \n\n. A low to moderate correlation has been consistently found \n\nbetween the S-N and J-P dichotomies of the MBTI. Myers \nbelieved, as do many current type experts, that this relation- \nship represents a real and natural association between the \ntwo dichotomies and is not simply attributable to measure- \nment or sample error. Chapter 7 further explicates the ratio- \nnale for this relationship. \n\nChapter 3 \n\nl: \n\nD \n\nMyers and Briggs also use both of these terms, attitude and \norientation, as equivalent when referring to Extraversion \nand Introversion. \n\n. Myers and Briggs use the term process interchangeably with \n\nJungs term function. In his writings, Jung occasionally used \nthe term process as denoting the same thing as function. The \nMBTI manual treats the two terms as equivalent but for clar- \nity and consistency uses the term function in most instances. \n\n. This method of determining type dynamicsthat is, which \n\nof the functions is dominant, auxiliary, and so onis a dis- \ntinctive feature of the MBTI. The Jungian Type Survey \n(Wheelwright, Wheelwright, &amp; Buehler, 1964), which pur- \nports to elicit Jungs psychological types, does not include a \nfourth dichotomy such as J-P Dominant versus auxiliary \nfunctions are determined by a higher score criterion. See \nChapters 5 and 9 for a discussion of comparative clarity of \npreference for MBTI dominant and auxiliary functions. \n\n. Intellectual tradition and various research approaches have \n\nassociated creativity with an Intuitive preference. When cre- \nativity is defined as the creation of something new that has \nnot existed before, one can appropriately describe Sensing \nperception as \"creative\" as well. The process whereby Sens- \ning develops something new may be the step-by-step, \nmethodical, and detailed procedure characteristic of intro- \nverted Sensing, or the extraverted Sensing process of creating \nsomething new by adapting and combining whatever ele- \nments are available in the current situation. The Sensing \nprocess is in contrast to the flashes of insight that we associ- \nate with Intuition. However, the product created through \neither introverted or extraverted Sensing may be a new one \nthat has not existed before. A likely example of introverted \n\nTl",

Measures of shyness are typically correlated with various \n\nmeasures of Introversion, including Introversion as elicited \non the MBTI This is an inevitable consequence of the over- \nlap in content of test items used to identify Introversion and \nshyness. However, shyness and Introversion are not neces- \nsarily related. Some Extraverts describe themselves as \nsocially shy, and some Introverts describe themsclves as \nsocially outgoing or gregarious. The E-I subscales of the \nStep I] Expanded Interpretive Report (EIR) shed some light \non this observation. \n\n. When referring to the two attitudes specified by Jung, \n\ntherefore, only Extraversion and Introversion are meant. \nMyers and Briggs referred to their added dichotomy of \nJudging versus Perceiving as attitudes or orientations. The \nMBTI manual uses both of these terms interchangeably in \nreferring to the Extraversion versus Introversion attitudes or \norientations, and the Judging versus Perceiving attitudes or \norientations. \n\n. This view was implied in some of Jungs writings (sce previ- \n\nous discussion on page 28). Two other hypotheses have \nbeen advanced. One (Grant, Thompson, &amp; Clark, 1983) \nsees the tertiary as taking the same attitude as the dominant \nfunction; the other (Quenk, 1993) favors the notion that \nthe tertiary may take either attitude, depending on circum- \nstances or individual habits. Toward the end of her life, \nIsabel Myers appeared to favor this latter view (Quenk, \n1993; see footnote 3.8, p. 276). \n\n. The approach taken in the Jungian Type Survey (Whecl- \n\nwright, Wheelwright, &amp; Buehler, 1964) is that the orienta- \ntion or attitude of both dominant and auxiliary functions is \nto the preferred attitude of Extraversion or Introversion. In \nthis system, only the unconscious inferior function is ori- \nented toward the less-preferred attitude. \n\n. An inevitable psychometric consequence of differential type \n\ndevelopment in young people, as well as incomplete devel- \nopment in an indeterminate percentage of adults, is that \nreliability estimates appear lower than would be the casc if \nall respondents were mature and well developed in their \ntype. See Chapter 8 for further explanation of this impor- \ntant aspect of type development theory. \n\nResearch on brain activity patterns (see Chapter 9) provides \nemerging empirical evidence for the innate nature of type \npreferences. \n\n387 \n\n388 MBTI Manual \nChapter 4 \nl.

A correlation coefficient used when both \nvariables being correlated represent, or have been split into, \ntwo or more categories. \n\nprediction ratio. The formula used for item analysis of MBTI \nforms preceding Form M, which shows the probability that \nany response is given in accord with total scale score (e.g., \nthe probability that a response designed for Extraverts is \ngiven by Extraverts and not given by Introverts). The pre- \ndiction ratio is designed to indicate how well any item dis- \ncriminates between choices for its scored preference. \n\npreference. One of each pair of the four basic mental functions \nand attitudes that in tvpe theory structure an individual's \npersonality. Each type dichotomy comprises two prefer- \nences: Extraversion or Introversion, Sensing or Intuition, \nThinking or Feeling, and Judging or Perceiving. \n\npreference clarity. An estimate of the extent to which a respon- \ndent reports favoring one pole of a dichotomy over its \nopposite, based on responses to the MBTI. Such estimates \ninclude the preference score calculated on forms preceding \nForm M, and the preference clarity category and preference \nclarity index used with Form M. See also preference clarity \ncategory and preference clarity index. \n\npreference clarity category (pcc). A term for a range of preference \nclarity indexes that designates the clarity of a reported pref- \nerence for one or the other pole of a dichotomy. The prefer- \nence clarity categories are as follows: \n\nslight: pci = 1-5 \nmoderate: pci 2 615 \nclear: pci = 16-25 \n\nvery clear: pci = 26-30 \nFor template and self-scored versions of the MBTI, the pec \nis obtained from the raw points associated with each preter- \nence. For the ranges used, see Table 5.4, page 112. \n\npreference clarity index (pci). A ratio showing how consistently a \nperson answered the questions on the scale of interest com- \npared to the maximum possihle score achievable on that \nscale. It is analogous to what was formerly referred to as a \npreference score. The pci is the basic result of scoring the \nMBTI. It consists of a letter to denote the direction of prefer- \nence and a number to indicate the clarity or the consistency \nwith which the person indicated that preference. The pci is \nderived by dividing the theta score for a person by the maxi- \nmum theta possible for that preference for that scale (using \nthe national sample as a base population), multiplying by 30, \nand rounding up to the nearest integer. Thus, all preference \nclarity indexes are standardized ona scale from I to 30. \n\npreference domain. A set of characteristics that define one of the \neight bipolar preferences (E, I, S, N, T, E J, P) of the MBTI \ntypology \n\npreference score. On MBTI forms that preceded Form M, a num- \nber designed to show how consistently a respondent chose \none pole of a dichotomy over its opposite. The correspond- \ning term for Form M is preference clarity index. \n\nPRELIS. A statisucal software package used to prepare data sets \nfor use by another statistical software package, LISREL. \n\nprocess. See function. \n\nH \n\npsychological opposite. An item option that is not necessarily log- \nically opposite to the other option, but rather is attractive to \nan individual who holds the preference that the option is \nintended to elicit. Item options serve as stimuli to evoke the \ndesired response rather than as grammatically consistent \npairings. \n\nr. See reliability coefficient. \n\nraw points. On the Form M self-scorable and Form M template \nversions of the MBTI, the sum of item responses for each \npreference in a dichotomy. The term points was also used on \nforms that preceded Form M. Neither the raw points of \nForm M nor the points of previous forms is interpretable, \nbeing only a step in determining either the preference clar- \nity index or preference score. \n\nreliability coefficient (r). In classical test theory (CTT), a number \n(a correlation coefficient or a percent agreement) indicating \nthe consistency with which a given sample of respondents \nanswers the test items. Reliability coefficients are calculated \nfor consistency over time (test-retest reliability) as well as \nconsistency among the items on a given scale (internal con- \nsistency reliability). \n\nreported type.

Formula used to estimate the reliabil- \nity of a long form using the known reliabilities of a form \nwith fewer items. \n\nsplit-half reliability. A method of assessing the internal consis- \ntency of a scale based on splitting the items into two parts \nthat are assumed to be equivalent and then correlating the \nscores from the two parts. \n\nsplit-half scores (also called X-half and Y-half scores). Scores \ndeveloped from splitting a scale into two halves; used for \ncomputing split-half reliabilities. Half of the questions are \nassigned to what is called the X scale and half to the Y scale. \n\nstandard error (SE). An estimate of the degree to which a score is \ncharacterized by unsystematic sources of variance. The \nhigher the standard error, the less precise the score and the \nmore noise there is in the score. Classical test theory \n(CTT) traditionally uses a single standard error for the \nentire scale; item response theory (IRT) provides a measure \nof standard error at each value of theta. \n\nstatic level of interpretation. In contrast to the dynamic or devel- \nopmental level of interpretation, a way ol understanding \ntype that is limited to definitions and characteristics of the \nfour dichotomies considered separately, that is, with no \nattention to dynamic interactions among the preferences or \ndevelopmental issues in the expression of type. \n\nstatistical interaction.

Theta scores correspond directly to \nMBTI continuous scores that were calculated using the pre- \ndiction ratio method developed by Isabel Myers. Theta \nscores can be dichotomized by identifying a cut-off point or \nmidpoint that separates individuals into two groups, associ- \nated with the poles of a dichotomy. \n\nThinking (T).

A person who prefers using Thinking over Feeling \nas a way of making judgments. \n\nthree-parameter model. In item response theory, the use of three \nparameters to model the relationship between item re- \nsponses and the latent characteristic that the items are \ndesigned to measure. The three parameters are \na paxameter: the amount of information available from the \n\nitem; the slope of the item characteristic curve at any \ngiven value of theta; higher a parameters provide \nmore information or discrimination among people \nwith different levels of theta \n\nb parameter: a measure of item difficulty based on the area \non the theta scale at which a test item produces the \nmaximum amount of information regarding the per- \nsons score on the psychological characteristic in \nquestion. Because the right end of the scale is arbi- \ntrarily defined as the keyed direction in IRT (the I, N, \nE. or P poles in the MBTI), items with very high b \nparameters discriminate between people with very \nclear preferences as compared to those with clear \npreferences. The most desirable MBTI items are \nthose that provide maximum information at the mid- \npoint of each dichotomy rather than at the \"ex- \ntremes, i.e., those that accurately identify Introverts \nversus Extraverts, Sensing types versus [ntuitives, \nand so on. \n\nc parameter: defines the baseline for item endorsement rates \nthat would be expected from individuals who score \nvery far to the low (left) end of the theta scale. In \nMBTI terms, for example, the probability that some- \none who is \"very clear about their preference for \nExtraversion would endorse the opposite, Intro- \nverted response to an El item. In aptitude or achieve- \nment tests, this is the \"guessing\" parameter.
