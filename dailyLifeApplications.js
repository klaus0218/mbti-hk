Begin each day with a 15-minute planning session, reviewing the day's schedule, priorities, and potential challenges. Use this time to mentally prepare for upcoming interactions and set realistic expectations for what can be accomplished. Morning routines should include physical activity, even if just 10-15 minutes of stretching or walking, to activate the body and mind. ISTJs should establish consistent wake-up times, allowing their natural circadian rhythms to stabilize and improve sleep quality. Morning nutrition should focus on protein-rich foods that provide sustained energy throughout the day, avoiding sugary breakfasts that can cause energy crashes.
